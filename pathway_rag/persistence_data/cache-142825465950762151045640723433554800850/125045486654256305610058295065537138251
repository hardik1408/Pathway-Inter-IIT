After giving our anxious consideration to the matter, both on facts and on law, we come to the following conclusion blockquote blockquote id"blockquote3" i Foreign law firms or foreign lawyers cannot practice the profession of law in India either on the litigation or nonlitigation side, unless they fulfil the requirement of the a href"doc262262" id"a3"Advocates Act, 1961a and the Bar Council of India Rules. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote4" ii However, there is no bar either in the Act or the Rules for the foreign law firms or foreign lawyers to visit India for a temporary period on a quotfly in and fly outquot basis, for the purpose of giving legal advise to their clients in India regarding foreign law or their own system of law and on diverse international legal issues. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote5" iii Moreover, having regard to the aim and object of the International Commercial Arbitration introduced in the a href"doc1306164" id"a4"Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996a, foreign lawyers cannot be debarred to come to India and conduct arbitration proceedings in respect of disputes arising out of a contract relating to international commercial arbitration. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote6" iv The B.P.O.

The Bombay High Court, on the other hand, concluded as follows p blockquote id"blockquote7" 60. For all the aforesaid reasons, we hold that in the facts of the present case, the RBI was not justified in granting permission to the foreign law firms to open liaison offices in India under a href"doc1140599" id"a6"Section 29a of the 1973 Act. We further hold that the expressions x27 to practise the profession of lawx27 in a href"doc1140599" id"a7"Section 29a of the 1961 Act is wide enough to cover the persons practising in litigious matters as well as persons practising in non litigious matters and, therefore, to practise in non litigious matters in India, the respondent Nos. 12 to 14 were bound to follow the provisions contained in the 1961 Act. The petition is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs. blockquotep datastructure"Precedent" id"p6"4. When the matter against the judgment of the Madras High Court came up for hearing before this Court on 4 th July, 2012, following interim order was passed p blockquote id"blockquote8" In the meanwhile, it is clarified that Reserve Bank of India shall not grant any permission to the foreign law firms to open liaison offices in India under a href"doc1961116" id"a8"Section 29a of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. It is also clarified that the expression quotto practice the profession of lawquot blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote9" under a href"doc1140599" id"a9"Section 29a of the Advocates Act, 1961 covers the persons practicing litigious matters as well as nonlitigious matters other than contemplated in para 63ii of the impugned order and, therefore, to practice in nonlitigious matters in India the foreign law firms, by whatever name called or described, shall be bound to follow the provisions contained in the a href"doc262262" id"a10"Advocates Act, 1961a.

In Civil Appeal Nos.78757879 of 2015, writ petition was filed before the Madras High Court by one A.K. Balaji, Advocate. Apart from official respondents, 32 law firms of U.K., U.S.A., France and Australia have been impleaded as respondents 9 to 40. Prayer in the writ petition is to take action against the original respondents 9 to 40 or any other foreign law firms or foreign lawyers illegally practicing the profession of law in India and direct them to refrain from having any illegal practice on the litigation side and in the field of commercial transactions in any manner whatsoever. p p datastructure"Issue" id"p8"PLEADINGS pp datastructure"Section" id"p9"6. Averments in the petition are that the writ petitioner was an advocate enrolled with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu. To practice law in India, a person has to be Indian citizen and should possess degree in law from a recognized University in India. Nationals of other countries could be admitted as advocates in India only if citizens of India are permitted to practice in such other countries. Foreign degree of law from a University outside India requires recognition by the Bar Council of India. The Indian advocates are not allowed to practice in U.K., U.S.A., Australia and other foreign nations except on fulfilling onerous restrictions like qualifying tests, span class"hiddentext" id"span13" 4span experience, work permit. Foreign lawyers cannot be allowed to practice in India without reciprocity. p p datastructure"Issue" id"p10"7. a href"doc262262" id"a11"Under the Advocates Acta the Act, a foreigner is not entitled to practice in India in view of bar contained in Section pp datastructure"CDiscource" id"p11"29. However, under the guise of LPOs Legal Process Outsourcing, conducting seminars and arbitrations, foreign lawyers are visiting India on Visitor Visa and practicing illegally. They also violate tax and immigration laws. They have also opened their offices in India for practice in the fields of mergers, takeovers, acquisitions, amalgamations, etc. Disciplinary jurisdiction of the Bar Council extends only to advocates enrolled under the Act. In India, the legal profession is considered as a noble profession to serve the society and not treated as a business but the foreign law firms treat the profession as trade and business venture to earn money. Indian lawyers are prohibited from advertising, canvassing and solicit work but foreign law firms are advertising through websites and canvass and solicit work by assuring results. Many accountancy and management firms are also employing graduates and thus rendering legal services. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p12"8. The stand of the Union of India initially was that if foreign law firms are not allowed to take part in negotiations, span class"hiddentext" id"span14" 5span settling of documents and arbitrations in India, it will obstruct the aim of making India a hub of international arbitration. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p13"Many arbitrations with Indian Judges as arbitrators and Indian lawyers are held outside India where foreign and Indian law firms advise their clients. Barring the entry of foreign law firms for arbitrations in India will result in many arbitrations shifting to Singapore, Paris and London, contrary to the declared policy of the Government and against national interest. However, its final stand in affidavits dated 19 th April, 2011 and 17th November, 2011 was different as recorded in Para 3 of the High Court Judgment as follows p blockquote id"blockquote10" 3 . The first respondent Union of India filed four counter affidavits on 19.08.2010, 24.11.2010, 19.04.2011 and 17.11.2011. In one of the counter affidavits, it is stated that the Bar Council of India, which has been established under the a href"doc262262" id"a12"Advocates Act, 1961a, regulates the advocates who are on the quotRollsquot, but law firms as such are not required to register themselves before any statutory authority, nor do they require any permission to engage in non blockquotep datastructure"CDiscource" id"p14" litigation practice. Exploiting this loophole, many accountancy and management firms are employing law graduates who are rendering legal services, which is contrary to the provisions of the a href"doc262262" id"a13"Advocates Acta. It is stated that the Government of India along with the Bar Council of India is considering this issue and is trying to formulate a regulatory framework in this regard. The 1st respondent in his counter warns that if the foreign law firms are not allowed to take part in negotiations, settling up documents and arbitrations in India, it will have a counter productive effect on the aim of the government to make India a hub of International Arbitration. In this connection, it is stated that many arbitrations with Indian Judges and Lawyers as Arbitrators are held outside India, where both foreign and Indian Law Firms advise their clients. If foreign law firms are denied entry to deal span class"hiddentext" id"span15" 6span with arbitrations in India, then India will lose many of the arbitrations to Singapore, Paris and London. It will be contrary to the declared policy of the government and against the national interest. In the counter affidavit filed on 19.04.2011, it is stated that a proposal to consider an amendment to a href"doc1140599" id"a14"Section 29a of the Advocates Act, 1961 permitting foreign law firms to practice law in India in non litigious matters on a reciprocity basis with foreign countries is under consultation with the Bar Council of India. Finally, in the counter filed on 17.11.2011, it is stated that the Government of India has decided to support the stand of the Bar Council of India that the provisions of the a href"doc262262" id"a15"Advocates Act, 1961a would apply with equal force to both litigious and nonlitigious practice of law, and it is only persons enrolled under a href"doc739001" id"a16"Section 24a of the Act, who can practice before the Indian Courts. emphasis added pp datastructure"Section" id"p15"9. In this Court, stand of the Union of India is that presently it is waiting for the Bar Council of India to frame rules on the subject. However, it can frame rules under a href"doc1897685" id"a17"Section 49Aa at any stage. p p datastructure"PetArg" id"p16"span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"62936" id"span16"10. Stand of the Bar Council of India before the High Court is that even non litigious practice is included in the practice of law which can be done only by advocates enrolled under the Act. Reliance was placed on the judgment of the Bombay High Court in a href"doc62936" id"a18"Lawyers Collectivea supra. Further reference was made to a href"doc739001" id"a19"Sections 24a and a href"doc1140599" id"a20"29a of the Act.span p p datastructure"Section" id"p17"a href"doc944251" id"a21"Section 472a read with a href"doc1965838" id"a22"Section 491ea provides for span class"hiddentext" id"span17" 7span recognition of qualifications of foreigners being recognized for practice. It was submitted that practice of foreign lawyers in India should be subject to regulatory powers of the Bar Council. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p18"11. Stand of the foreign law firms, inter alia, is that there is no bar to a company carrying on consultancysupport services in the field of protection and management of intellectual, business and industrial proprietary rights, carrying out market service and market research, publication of reports, journals etc. A person not appearing before Courts or Tribunals and not giving legal advice cannot be said to be practice of law. The ninth respondent stated that it was a part of group of companies and not a law firm and was duly registered under the a href"doc1353758" id"a23"Indian Companies Act, 1956a. The tenth respondent, another foreign law firm, submitted that there is no violation of law in giving advice on foreign law. Even Indian lawyers are permitted to practice outside India and issue of reciprocity is a policy matter to be decided by the Government of India. It does not have a law office in India and does not give advice on Indian laws. In England, foreign lawyers are free to advice on their own system of law without nationality requirement or qualification of England. The span class"hiddentext" id"span18" 8span eleventh respondent is an American law firm and submitted that it advises clients on international legal issues from different countries. Indian clients are given advice through Indian lawyers and law firms which are enrolled with the Bar Council. There is no discrimination in U.S. against Indian citizens practicing law. Indian lawyers travel to US on temporary basis for consultation on Indian law issues. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p19"12. a href"doc262262" id"a24"The Acta and the Bar Council Rules govern practice of Indian law and not foreign law. Participation in seminars and conferences does not constitute practice in law. The fourteenth respondent denied the existence of its office in India and that it was practicing Indian law. It also took the same stand as Respondent No.11 that regulatory framework for advocates did not govern practice of foreign law. It denied that it is operating a Legal Process Outsourcing office LPOs in India. Its lawyers fly in and fly out of India on need basis to advice clients on international transactions. To the extent Indian law is involved, such matters are addressed by Indian lawyers. If the foreign law firms are prevented from advice on foreign law, the transaction cost of Indian clients for consultation on foreign law will increase. Other foreign law firms have also taken more or less similar stand. p span class"hiddentext" id"span19" 9span p datastructure"RespArg" id"p20" Fifteenth respondent stated that it is a Business Process Outsourcing BPO company providing wide range of customized and integrated services and functions. The sixteenth respondent also stated that it has no office in India and is only rendering services other than practice of Indian law. The eighteenth respondent stated that it does not have any office in India and does not practice law in India. It only advises on non Indian law. Respondent Nos.19, 26, 39 and 40 stated that they are limited law partnerships under Laws of England. They do not have any law office in India. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p21"Respondents Nos.20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 and 38 also stated that they do not have any office in India and do not practice Indian law. Indian lawyers cannot advice on foreign laws and the requirement of Indian litigants in regard is met by foreign lawyers. Its lawyers fly in and fly out of India on need basis to advise the clients on international transactions. To the extent Indian law is involved such matters are addressed by Indian lawyers. p p datastructure"Section" id"p22"13. The respondent No.22 stated that it is an international law firm but does not have any office in India. It advises clients on laws other than Indian laws. Its India Practice Group advises clients on commercial matters involving an span class"hiddentext" id"span20" 10span quotIndian Elementquot relating to mergers, acquisitions, capital markets, projects, energy and infrastructure, etc. from an international legal perspective and it does not amount to practice in Indian law. Respondent No.23 stated that it is only advising on matters of English, European Union and Hong Kong laws. It has working relationships with leading law firms in major jurisdictions and instructs appropriate local law firms to provide local law advice. Respondent No.29 stated that it is a limited law partnership registered in England and Wales and does not have office in India. It does not represent parties in Indian courts nor advises on Indian law. p p datastructure"RespArg" id"p23"Respondent No.35 stated that it does not maintain any office in India and its expertise in international law. 36 th Respondent stated that it does not practice Indian law and has no office in India nor it operates any LPO. Its lawyers fly in and fly out on need basis to advise clients on international transactions or matters involving Australian laws or international Benches to which there is an Indian component. p p datastructure"Section" id"p24"Working of Indian laws is entrusted to Indian lawyers. The 37th Respondent denied that it has any office in India or is running LPO in India. It only advises with respect to regulatory laws other than Indian law. p span class"hiddentext" id"span21" 11span p datastructure"Issue" id"p25" FINDINGS pp datastructure"Precedent" id"p26"14. The High Court upheld the plea of the foreign law firms to the effect that there was no bar to such firms taking part in negotiations, settling of documents and conducting arbitrations in India. There was no bar to carrying on consultancysupport services in the field of protection and management of intellectual, business and industrial proprietary rights, carrying out market survey and research, publication of reports, journals etc. without rendering any legal advice. This could not be treated as practice of law in India. Referring to a href"doc1279791" id"a25"Section 21fa of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 the a href"doc1052228" id"a26"Arbitration Acta, it was observed that if in international commercial arbitration, India is chosen as the seat of arbitration, the foreign contracting party is bound to seek assistance from lawyers of their own country on the contract. There could be no prohibition for such foreign lawyers to advise their clients on the foreign law. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p27"15. Judgment of the Bombay High Court in Lawyers Collective supra was distinguished on the ground that setting up of law offices for litigious and non litigious matters was different but if a foreign law firm without establishing span class"hiddentext" id"span22" 12span any liaison office in India offers advice to their clients on foreign law, there was no legal bar to do so. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p28"16. The Bombay High Court in its judgment observed p blockquote id"blockquote11" 44. It appears that before approaching RBI, these foreign law firms had approached the Foreign Investment Promotion Board FIPB for short a High Powered body established under the New Industrial Policy seeking their approval in the matter. The FIPB had rejected the proposal submitted by the foreign law firms. Thereafter, these law firms sought approval from RBI and RBI granted the approval in spite of the rejection of FIPB. Though specific grievance to that effect is made in the petition, the RBI has chosen not to deal with those grievances in its affidavit in reply. Thus, in the present case, apparently, the stand taken by RBI amp FIPB are mutually contradictory. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote12" 45. In any event, the fundamental question to be considered herein is, whether the foreign law firms namely respondent Nos. 12 to 14 by opening liaison offices in India could carry on the practise in non litigious matters without being enrolled as Advocates under the 1961 Act ? blockquote blockquote id"blockquote13" 46. Before dealing with the rival contentions on the above question, we may quote a href"doc1140599" id"a27"Sections 29a, a href"doc756229" id"a28"30a, a href"doc510150" id"a29"33a and a href"doc1460739" id"a30"35a of the 1961 Act, which read thus blockquote blockquote id"blockquote14" 29.

The argument of the foreign law firms is that a href"doc1140599" id"a33"Section 29a of the 1961 Act is declaratory in nature and the said section merely specifies the persons who are entitled to practise the profession of law. According to the respondent Nos. 12 to 14, the expression x27entitled to practise the profession of lawx27 in a href"doc1140599" id"a34"Section 29a of the 1961 Act does not specify the field in which the profession of law could be practised. It is a href"doc510150" id"a35"Section 33a of the 1961 Act which provides that advocates alone are entitled to practise in any Court or before any authority or person. Therefore, according to respondent Nos. 12 to 14 the 1961 Act applies to persons practising as advocates before any Court authority and not to persons practising in non litigious matters. The question, therefore, to be considered is, whether the 1961 Act span class"hiddentext" id"span25" 15span applies only to persons practising in litigious matters, that is, practising before Court and other authorities ? p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p42"48. In the statements of Objects amp Reasons for enacting the 1961 Act, it is stated that the main object of the Act is to establish All India Bar Council and a common roll of advocates and Advocate on the common roll having a right to practise in any part of the country and in any Court, including the Supreme Court. Thus, from the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is seen that the 1961 Act is intended to apply to one persons practising the profession of law in any part of the country and two persons practising the profession of law in any Court including the Supreme Court. Thus, from the statement of objects and reasons it is evident that the 1961 Act is intended to apply not only to the persons practising before the Courts but it is also intended to apply to persons who are practising in non litigious matters outside the Court. p p datastructure"Section" id"p43"49. Apart from the above, a href"doc1140599" id"a36"Section 29a of the 1961 Act specifically provides is that from the appointed day, there shall be only one class of persons entitled to practice the profession of law, namely Advocates. It is apparent that prior to the 1961 Act there were different classes of persons entitled to practise the profession of law and from the appointed day all these class of persons practising the profession of law, would form one class, namely, advocates. Thus, a href"doc1140599" id"a37"Section 29a of the 1961 Act clearly provides that from the appointed day only advocates are entitled to practise the profession of law whether before any Court authority or outside the Court by way of practise in non litigious matters. p p datastructure"Section" id"p44"50. a href"doc510150" id"a38"Section 33a of the 1961 Act is a prohibitory section in the sense that it debars any person from appearing before any Court or authority unless he is enrolled as an advocate under the 1961 Act. The bar contained in a href"doc510150" id"a39"Section 33a of the 1961 Act has nothing to do with the persons entitled to be enrolled as advocates span class"hiddentext" id"span26" 16span under a href"doc1140599" id"a40"Section 29a of the 1961 Act. A person enrolled as an advocate under a href"doc1140599" id"a41"Section 29a of the 1961 Act, may or may not be desirous of appearing before the Courts. He may be interested in practising only in non litigious matters. Therefore, the bar under a href"doc510150" id"a42"Section 33a from appearing in any Court except when permitted by Court under a href"doc1577844" id"a43"Section 32a of the 1961 Act or any other Act unless enrolled as an advocate does not bar a person from being enrolled as an advocate under a href"doc1140599" id"a44"Section 29a of the 1961 Act for practising the profession of law in non litigious matters. The Apex Court in the case of ExCapt. Harish Uppal supra has held that the right to practise is the genus of which the right to appear and conduct cases in the Court may be a specie. Therefore, the fact that a href"doc510150" id"a45"Section 33a of the 1961 Act provides that advocates alone are entitled to practice before any Court authority it cannot be inferred that the 1961 Act applies only to persons practising in litigious matters and would not apply to person practising in non litigious matters. p p datastructure"PetArg" id"p45"51. It was contended that the 1961 Act does not contain any penal provisions for breaches committed by a person practicing in non pp datastructure"PetArg" id"p46"litigious matter and, therefore, the 1961 Act cannot apply to persons practising in non litigious matters. There is no merit in this contention, because, a href"doc1460739" id"a46"Section 35a of the 1961 Act provides punishment to an advocate who is found to be guilty of professional or other misconduct. The fact that a href"doc286540" id"a47"Section 45a of the 1961 Act provides imprisonment for persons illegally practicing in Courts and before other authorities, it cannot be said that the 1961 Act does not contain provisions to deal with the persons found guilty of misconduct while practising in non litigious matters. Once it is held that the persons entitled to practice the profession of law under the 1961 Act covers the persons practising the profession of law in litigious matters as well as nonlitigious matters, then, the penal provisions contained in a href"doc1460739" id"a48"Section 35a of the 1961 Act would apply not only to persons practising in litigious matter, but would also apply to persons practising the profession of law in nonlitigious matters. The span class"hiddentext" id"span27" 17span very object of the 1961 Act and the Rules framed by the Bar Council of India are to ensure that the persons practising the profession of law whether in litigious matters or in non litigious matters, maintain high standards in professional conduct and etiquette and, therefore, it cannot be said that the persons practising in non litigious matters are not governed by the 1961 Act. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p47"52 . Strong reliance was placed by the counsel for the respondent No. 12 on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of O.N. Mohindroo supra in support of his contention that the 1961 Act applies only to persons practising the profession of law before Courts Tribunals other authorities. It is true that the Apex Court in the above case has held that the 1961 Act is enacted by the Parliament in exercise of its powers under entry 77 and 78 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. pp datastructure"Precedent" id"p48"However, the fact that entry 77 and 78 in List I refers to the persons practising before the Supreme Court and the High Courts, it cannot be said that the 1961 Act is restricted to the persons practising only before the Supreme Court and High Courts. Practising the profession of law involves a larger concept whereas, practising before the Courts is only a part of that concept. If the literal construction put forth by the respondents is accepted then, the Parliament under entry 77 amp 78 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to make legislation only in respect of the advocates practicing before the Supreme Court High Courts and the Parliament cannot legislate under that entry in respect of advocates practising before the District Courts Magistratex27s Courts other Courts Tribunals authorities and consequently, the 1961 Act to the extent it applies to advocates practising in Courts other than the High Courts and Supreme Court would be ultra vires the Constitution. Such a narrow construction is unwarranted because, once the Parliament invokes its power to legislate on advocates practising the profession of law, then the entire field relating to advocates would be open to the Parliament to legislate and accordingly the 1961 Act has been enacted span class"hiddentext" id"span28" 18span to cover the entire field. In any event, the question as to whether the persons practicing the profession of law exclusively in non litigious matters are covered under the 1961 Act, or not was not an issue directly or indirectly considered by the Apex Court in the case of O.N. Mohindroo supra. Therefore, the decision of the Apex Court in the above case does not support the case of the contesting respondents. pp datastructure"Section" id"p49" .. pp datastructure"Section" id"p50" .. p p datastructure"Section" id"p51"55. It was contended by the counsel for Union of India that if it is held that the 1961 Act applies to persons practising in nonlitigious matters, then no bureaucrat would be able to draft or give any opinion in nonlitigious matters without being enrolled as an advocate. There is no merit in the above argument, because, there is a distinction between a bureaucrat drafting or giving opinion, during the course of his employment and a law firm or an advocate drafting or giving opinion to the clients on professional basis. Moreover, a bureaucrat drafting documents or giving opinion is answerable to his superiors, whereas, a law firm or an individual engaged in non litigious matters, that is, drafting documents giving opinion or rendering any other legal assistance are answerable to none. To avoid such anomaly, the 1961 Act has been enacted so as to cover all persons practising the profession of law be it in litigious matters or in nonlitigious matters within the purview of the 1961 Act. p p datastructure"PetArg" id"p52"span class"citetext" datasentiment"Pos" datadocid"109500" id"span29"56. The argument that the 1961 Act and the Bar Councils constituted there under have limited role to play has been time and again negatived by the Apex Court. Recently, the Apex Court in the case of a href"doc109500" id"a49"Bar Council of India v. Board of Management, Dayanand College of Lawa reported in MANUSC52192006 span pblockquote id"blockquote21"2007 2 SCC 202 held thus blockquote blockquote id"blockquote22" It may not be correct to say that the Bar Council of India is totally unconcerned with the legal education, though primarily legal education may also be within the province span class"hiddentext" id"span30" 19span of the universities. But, as the apex professional body, the Bar Council of India is concerned with the standards of the legal profession and the equipment of those who seek entry into that profession. The Bar Council of India is also thus concerned with the legal education in the country. Therefore, instead of taking a pendantic view of the situation, the State Government and the recommending authority are expected to ensure that the requirement set down by the Bar Council of India is also complied with. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote23" Thus, when efforts are being made to see that the legal profession stand tall in this fast changing world, it would be improper to hold that the 1961 Act and the Bar Council constituted there under have limited role to play in the field relating to practising the profession of law. blockquote p datastructure"PetArg" id"p53"57. It is not in dispute that once a person is enrolled as an advocate, he is entitled to practise the profession of law in litigious matters as well as nonlitigious matters. If the argument of the respondents that the 1961 Act is restricted to the persons practising the profession of law in litigious matters is accepted, then an advocate found guilty of misconduct in performing his duties while practising in nonlitigious matters cannot be punished under the 1961 Act. Similarly, where an advocate who is debarred for professional misconduct can merrily carry on the practise in nonlitigious matters on the ground that the 1961 Act is not applicable to the persons practising the profession of law in non litigious matters. Such an argument which defeats the object of the 1961 Act cannot be accepted. p p datastructure"Section" id"p54"58. It may be noted that Rule 61 in Chapter III Part VI of the Bar Council of India Rules framed under a href"doc1965838" id"a50"Section 491 aha of the 1961 Act provides that an advocate whose name has been removed by an order of the Supreme Court or a High Court or the Bar Council as the case may be, shall not be entitled to practise the profession of law either before the Court span class"hiddentext" id"span31" 20span and authorities mentioned under a href"doc756229" id"a51"Section 30a of the 1961 Act, or in chambers, or otherwise. The above rule clearly shows that the chamber practise, namely, practise in non litigious matters is also within the purview of the 1961 Act. p p datastructure"Issue" id"p55" 59 . Counsel for the Union of India had argued that the Central Government is actively considering the issue relating to the foreign law firms practising the profession of law in India. Since the said issue is pending before the Central Government for more than 15 years, we direct the Central Government to take appropriate decision in the matter as expeditiously as possible. Till then, the 1961 Act as enacted would prevail, that is, the persons practising the profession of law whether in litigious matters or non litigious matters would be governed by the 1961 Act and the Bar Councils framed there under, apart from the powers of the Court to take appropriate action against advocates who are found guilty of professional misconduct. p p datastructure"Conclusion" id"p56" 60. For all the aforesaid reasons, we hold that in the facts of the present case, the RBI was not justified in granting permission to the foreign law firms to open liaison offices in India under a href"doc1140599" id"a52"Section 29a of the 1973 Act. We further hold that the expressions x27 to practise the profession of lawx27 in a href"doc1140599" id"a53"Section 29a of the 1961 Act is wide enough to cover the persons practising in litigious matters as well as persons practising in non litigious matters and, therefore, to practise in non litigious matters in India, the respondent Nos. 12 to 14 were bound to follow the provisions contained in the 1961 Act. The petition is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs. pp datastructure"Precedent" id"p57"17. The Madras High Court agreed with the above view as follows p blockquote id"blockquote24" 44. As noticed above, the facts of the case before the Bombay High Court were that the respondents which were foreign law firms practising the profession of law in USUK sought permission to open their liaison office in India and render legal assistance to another person in all litigious and non litigious matters. The Bombay High Court, therefore, rightly held that establishing liaison office in India by the foreign law firm and rendering liaisoning span class"hiddentext" id"span32" 21span activities in all forms cannot be permitted since such activities are opposed to the provisions of the a href"doc262262" id"a54"Advocates Acta and the Bar Council of India Rules. We do not differ from the view taken by the Bombay High Court on this aspect. blockquotep datastructure"Precedent" id"p58"18. The Madras High Court after above observation proceeded to consider the matter as follows p blockquote id"blockquote25" 45 . However, the issue which falls for consideration before this Court is as to whether a foreign law firm, without establishing any liaison office in India visiting India for the purpose of offering legal advice to their clients in India on foreign law, is prohibited under the provisions of the a href"doc262262" id"a55"Advocates Acta. In other words, the question here is, whether a foreign lawyer visiting India for a temporary period to advise his client on foreign law can be barred under the provisions of the a href"doc262262" id"a56"Advocates Acta. This issue was neither raised nor answered by the Bombay High Court in the aforesaid judgment. blockquotep datastructure"Precedent" id"p59"19. It was held p blockquote id"blockquote26" 51. We find force in the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the foreign law firms that if foreign law firms are not allowed to take part in negotiations, for settling up documents and conduct arbitrations in India, it will have a counter productive effect on the aim of the Government to make India a hub of International Arbitration. According to the learned counsel, many arbitrations with Indian Judges and Lawyers as Arbitrators are held outside India, where both foreign and Indian law firms advise their clients. If foreign law firms are denied entry to deal with arbitrations in India, then India will lose many of the arbitrations to foreign countries. It will be contrary to the declared policy of the Government and against the national interest. Some of the companies have been carrying on consultancysupport services in the field of protection and management of intellectual, business and industrial proprietary rights, carrying out market surveys and market research and publication of span class"hiddentext" id"span33" 22span reports, journals, etc. without rendering any legal service, including advice in the form of opinion, but they do not appear before any courts or tribunals anywhere in India. Such activities cannot at all be considered as practising law in India. It has not been controverted that in England, foreign lawyers are free to advice on their own system of law or on English Law or any other system of law without any nationality requirement or need to be qualified in England. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote27"52. Before enacting the a href"doc1306164" id"a57"Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996a the Law Commission of India, several representative bodies of trade and industry and experts in the field of arbitration have proposed amendments to the Act to make it more responsive to contemporary requirements. It was also recognised that the economic reforms in India may not fully become effective if the law dealing with settlement of both domestic and international commercial disputes remains out of tune with such reforms. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law UNCITRAL adopted in 1985 the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. a href"doc1306164" id"a58"The Arbitration and Conciliation Acta is, therefore, consolidated and amended to the law relating to domestic and international commercial arbitration as well as for the enforcement of foreign arbitral award. a href"doc262262" id"a59"The Acta was enacted as a measure of fulfilling Indiax27s obligations under the International Treaties and Conventions. On account of the growth in the international trade and commerce and also on account of long delays occurring in the disposal of suits and appeals in courts, there has been tremendous movement towards the resolution of disputes through alternative forum of arbitrators. blockquote blockquote id"blockquote28"53. a href"doc142194" id"a60"Section 21fa of the Act defines the term quotInternational Commercial Arbitrationquot as under blockquote blockquote id"blockquote29" f International Commercial Arbitration means an arbitration relating to disputes arising out of legal relationships, whether contractual or not, considered as commercial under the law in force in India and where at least one of the parties is blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote30" i an individual who is a national of, or habitually resident in, any country other than India or span class"hiddentext" id"span34" 23span blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote31" ii a body corporate which is incorporated in any country other than India or blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote32" iii a company or an association or a body of individuals whose central management and control is exercised in any country other than India or blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote33" iv the Government of a foreign country. blockquote p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p60"54 . From the above definition, it is manifestly clear that any arbitration matter between the parties to the arbitration agreement shall be called an quotinternational commercial arbitrationquot if the matter relates to the disputes, which may or may not be contractual, but where at least one of the parties habitually resides abroad whether a national of that country or not. The New York Convention will apply to an arbitration agreement if it has a foreign element or flavour involving international trade and commerce, even though such an agreement does not lead to a foreign award. p p datastructure"Section" id"p61"55 . International arbitration is growing big time in India and in almost all the countries across the globe. India is a signatory to the World Trade Agreement, which has opened up the gates for many international business establishments based in different parts of the world to come and set up their respective businesses in India. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p62"56 . Large number of Indian Companies have been reaching out to foreign destinations by mergers, acquisition or direct investments. As per the data released by the Reserve Bank of India during 2009, the total out ward investment from India excluding that which was made by Banks, had increased 29.6 to U.S. Dollar 17.4 billion in 200708 and India is ranked third in global foreign direct investment. Overseas investments in joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries have been recognized as important avenues by Indian Entrepreneurs in terms of foreign exchange earning like dividend, loyalty, etc. India is the 7th largest, the second most populated country and the fourth largest economy in the world. Various economic reforms brought about have made India grow rapidly in the AsiaPacific Region, and the Indian Private Sector has offered considerable scope for foreign direct investment, jointventure and collaborations. Undoubtedly, these crossborder transactions and investments would span class"hiddentext" id"span35" 24span give bigger opportunities for members of the legal fraternity, in order to better equip themselves to face the challenges. It is common knowledge that in the recent past, parties conducting International Commercial Arbitrations have chosen India as their destination. The arbitration law in India is modelled on the lines of the UNCITRAL Model Law of Arbitration and makes a few departures from the principles enshrined therein. a href"doc1306164" id"a61"The Arbitration and Conciliation Acta 1996, provides for international commercial arbitration where at least one of the parties is not an Indian National or Body corporate incorporated in India or a foreign Government. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p63"57. Institutional Arbitration has been defined to be an arbitration conducted by an arbitral institution in accordance with the rules of the institution. The Indian Council of Arbitration is one such body. It is reported that in several cases of International Commercial Arbitration, foreign contracting party prefers to arbitrate in India and several reasons have been stated to choose India as the seat of arbitration. Therefore, when there is liberalization of economic policies, throwing the doors open to foreign investments, it cannot be denied that disputes and differences are bound to arise in such International contracts. When one of the contracting party is a foreign entity and there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties and India is chosen as the seat of arbitration, it is but natural that the foreign contracting party would seek the assistance of their own solicitors or lawyers to advice them on the impact of the laws of their country on the said contract, and they may accompany their clients to visit India for the purpose of the Arbitration. Therefore, if a party to an International Commercial Arbitration engages a foreign lawyer and if such lawyers come to India to advice their clients on the foreign law, we see there could be no prohibition for such foreign lawyers to advise their clients on foreign law in India in the course of a International Commercial transaction or an International Commercial Arbitration or matters akin thereto. Therefore, to advocate a proposition that foreign lawyers or foreign law firms cannot come into India to advice their clients on foreign law would be a far fetched and dangerous proposition and in our opinion, would be to take a step backward, when India is becoming a preferred seat for arbitration in span class"hiddentext" id"span36" 25span International Commercial Arbitrations. It cannot be denied that we have a comprehensive and progressive legal frame work to support International Arbitration and the 1996 Act, provides for maximum judicial support of arbitration and minimal intervention. That apart, it is not in all cases, a foreign company conducting an International Commercial Arbitration in India would solicit the assistance of their foreign lawyers. The legal expertise available in India is of International standard and such foreign companies would not hesitate to avail the services of Indian lawyers. Therefore, the need to make India as a preferred seat for International Commercial Arbitration would benefit the economy of the country. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p64"span class"citetext" datasentiment"PARTY" datadocid"115852355" id"span37"58. The Supreme Court in a recent decision in a href"doc115852355" id"a62"Vodafone International Holdings B.V. vs. Union of India and anothera, SLPC No.26529 of 2010, dated 20.01.2012, observed that every strategic foreign direct investment coming to India, as an investment destination should be seen in a holistic manner. The Supreme Court observed that the question involved in the said case was of considerable public importance, especially on Foreign Direct Investment, which is indispensable for a growing economy like India. Therefore, we should not lose site of the fact that in the overall economic growth of the country, International Commercial Arbitration would play a vital part. The learned counsel appearing for the foreign law firms have taken a definite stand that the clients whom they represent do not have offices in India, they do not advise their foreign clients on matters concerning Indian Law, but they fly in and fly out of India, only to advise and handhold their clients on foreign laws. The foreign law firms, who are the private respondents in this writ petition, have accepted the legal position that the term quotpracticequot would include both litigation as well as nonlitigation work, which is better known as chamber practice. Therefore, rendering advice to a client would also be encompassed in the term quotpracticequot.span p p datastructure"Section" id"p65"59. As noticed above, a href"doc1813579" id"a63"Section 2aa of the Advocates Act defines x27Advocatex27 to mean an advocate entered in any roll under the provisions of the Act. In terms of Section 171 of the Act, every State Bar Council shall prepare and maintain a roll of Advocates, in which shall be entered the names and addresses of span class"hiddentext" id"span38" 26span pp datastructure"Section" id"p66" a all persons who were entered as an Advocate on the roll of any High Court under the a href"doc214169" id"a64"Indian Bar Council Act, 1926a, immediately before the appointed date and b all other persons admitted to be Advocates on the roll of the State Bar Council under the Act on or after the appointed date. In terms of a href"doc168827" id"a65"Section 241a of the Act, subject to the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, a person shall be qualified to be admitted as an advocate on a state roll if he fulfils the conditions a a citizen of India, b has completed 21 years of age and c obtained a degree in Law. The proviso to a href"doc1741611" id"a66"Section 241aa states that subject to the other provisions of the Act, a National of any other country may be admitted as an Advocate on a State roll, if a citizen of India, duly qualified is permitted to practice law in that other country. In terms of a href"doc48718" id"a67"Section 471a of the Act, where any country specified by the Central Government by notification prevents citizens of India practicing the profession of Law or subjects them to unfair discrimination in that country, no subject of any such country shall be entitled to practice the profession of Law in India. In terms of SubSection 2 of a href"doc837666" id"a68"Section 47a, subject to the provision of SubSection 1, the Bar Council of India may prescribe conditions, if any, subject to which foreign qualifications in law obtained by persons other than citizens of India shall be recognized for the purpose of admission as an Advocate under the Act. Thus, a href"doc837666" id"a69"Section 47a deals with reciprocity. As per the statement of objects and reasons of the a href"doc262262" id"a70"Advocates Acta, it was a law enacted to provide one class of legal practitioners, specifying the academic and professional qualifications necessary for enrolling as a practitioner of Indian Law, and only Indian citizens with a Law Degree from a recognized Indian University could enrol as Advocates under the Act. The exceptions are provided under the proviso to a href"doc1741611" id"a71"Section 241aa, a href"doc277260" id"a72"Section 241civa and a href"doc944251" id"a73"Section 472a. In the light of the scheme of the Act, if a lawyer from a foreign law firm visits India to advice his client on matters relating to the law which is applicable to their country, for which purpose he quotflies in and flies outquot of India, there could not be a bar for such services rendered by such foreign law firmforeign lawyer. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p67"60 . We are persuaded to observe so, since there may be several transactions in which an Indian span class"hiddentext" id"span39" 27span company or a person of Indian origin may enter into transaction with a foreign company, and the laws applicable to such transaction are the laws of the said foreign country. There may be a necessity to seek legal advice on the manner in which the foreign law would be applied to the said transaction, for which purpose if a lawyer from a foreign law firm is permitted to fly into India and fly out advising their client on the foreign law, it cannot be stated to be prohibited. The corollary would be that such foreign law firm shall not be entitled to do any form of practice of Indian Law either directly or indirectly. The private respondents herein, namely the foreign law firms, have accepted that there is express prohibition for a foreign lawyer or a foreign law firm to practice Indian Law. It is pointed out that if an interpretation is given to prohibit practice of foreign law by a foreign law firms within India, it would result in a manifestly absurd situation wherein only Indian citizens with Indian Law degree who are enrolled as an advocate under the a href"doc262262" id"a74"Advocates Acta could practice foreign law, when the fact remains that foreign laws are not taught at graduate level in Indian Law schools, except Comparative Law Degree Courses at the Masterx27s level. p p datastructure"CDiscource" id"p68"61 . As noticed above, the Government of India, in their counter affidavit dated 19.08.2010, have stated that the contention raised by the petitioner that foreign law firms should not be allowed to take part in negotiating settlements, settling up documents and arbitrations will be counter productive, as International Arbitration will be confined to a single country. It is further pointed out that many arbitrations are held outside India with Indian Judges and Lawyers as Arbitrators where both foreign and Indian Law firms advise their clients. It has been further stated if foreign law firms are denied permission to deal with arbitration in India, then we would lose many arbitrations to other countries and this is contrary to the declared policy of the Government and will be against the National interest, especially when the Government wants India to be a hub of International Arbitration 62 . At this juncture, it is necessary to note yet another submission made by the Government of India in their counter. It has been stated that law firms as such or not required to register themselves span class"hiddentext" id"span40" 28span or require permission to engage in nonlitigation practice and that Indian law firms elsewhere are operating in a free environment without any curbs or regulations. It is further submitted that the oversight of the Bar Council on nonlitigation activities of such law firms was virtually nil till now, and exploiting this loop hole, many accountancy and management firms are employing law graduates, who are rendering legal services, which is contrary to the a href"doc262262" id"a75"Advocates Acta. Therefore, the concern of the Government of India as expressed in the counter affidavit requires to be addressed by the Bar Council of India. Further, it is seen that the Government in consultation with the Bar Council of India proposes to commission a study as to the nature of activities of LPOs, and an appropriate decision would be taken in consultation with the Bar Council of India. RIVAL CONTENTIONS pp datastructure"Precedent" id"p69"20. Shri C.U. Singh, learned senior counsel for the Bar Council of India submitted that Advocates enrolled with the Bar Council of India are the only recognized class of persons entitled to practice law in India. Unless any other law so permits, no person can practice before any Court, authority or person other than an Advocate enrolled under the Act. In particular cases, the Court, authority or person may permit a person other than an advocate enrolled under the Act to appear before him. It was submitted that the expression practice profession of law covered not only appearance before the Court but also opinion work which is also known as chamber practice. The Ethics prescribed by the Bar Council of India covered not only conduct in appearing before Court or authority but also in dealing with the clients including giving legal opinion, drafting or span class"hiddentext" id"span41" 29span participation in law conference. If a person practices before any Court, authority or person illegally, is liable to punishment for imprisonment which may extend to six months. Thus, the view taken by the Madras High Court that visit by a foreign lawyer on fly in and fly out basis to give advice on foreign law or to conduct arbitration in international commercial arbitrations was erroneous. p p datastructure"Section" id"p70"Reference has also been made to definition of the term advocate under a href"doc1813579" id"a76"Section 2aa of the Act. a href"doc946885" id"a77"Section 6a lays down functions of the Bar Council including admission of persons as advocates, safeguarding rights, privileges and interests of advocates. a href"doc481256" id"a78"Section 17a lays down that every State Bar Council shall prepare a roll of advocates and no person can be enrolled in more than one State Bar Council. a href"doc739001" id"a79"Section 24a lays down qualifications for admission on the roll of a State Bar council. The qualifications include the citizenship of India, unless a person is national of a country where citizens of India are permitted to practice. One is required to have the prescribed qualification from India or out of India if such degree is recognized by the Bar Council of India, being a Barrister called to the Bar before 31st December, 1976, passing of articled clerks examination or any other examination specified by the Bombay or Calcutta High Court or obtaining foreign qualification recognized by the Bar Council of India are also the prescribed qualifications. It was submitted that even in other jurisdictions, persons other than those span class"hiddentext" id"span42" 30span enrolled with the concerned Bar Council are not allowed to practice. p p datastructure"Conclusion" id"p71"Even short term running of legal service is subject to regulatory regime. p p datastructure"RespArg" id"p72"21. Learned counsel for the foreign law firms SShri Arvind Datar, Sajjan Poovayya, Dushyant Dave, learned senior counsel and Mr. Nakul Dewan, learned counsel supported the direction of the Madras High Court permitting foreign lawyers to render legal services on fly in and fly out basis and also with reference to international commercial arbitrations. It was submitted that Bar Council could come into picture only in respect of advocates enrolled with it. It is only with reference to appearance before the Courts or other authorities or persons that the regulatory regime of the Bar Council may apply but with regard to non litigationadvisory work even those not enrolled as advocates under the a href"doc262262" id"a80"Advocates Acta are not debarred. It was also submitted by Shri Dewan that a href"doc262262" id"a81"Advocates Acta applies only to individuals and not to law firms. Provision for reciprocity applies only for enrolment under the a href"doc262262" id"a82"Advocates Acta and not for casual legal services on fly in and fly out basis or in connection with international commercial arbitration. Foreign lawyers are regulated by the disciplinary regime applicable to them and only their Bar Councils could take action with regard to their working in India also. Practice of law in India did not cover advising on foreign law. Thus, if by a predetermined invitation, a foreign span class"hiddentext" id"span43" 31span lawyer visited India to advise on a foreign law, there is no bar against doing so. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p73"22. Certain decisions have been cited at the Bar to which reference may be made. In Roel versus New York County Lawyers Association3, the Court of Appeals of the State of New York dealt with a case where a Mexican citizen and lawyer, who was not a citizen of the United States nor a member of the New York Bar, maintained his office in New York and advised members of the public on Mexican law. He did not give any advice as to New York law. The majority held that this was not permissible. It was observed p blockquote id"blockquote34" To allow a Mexican lawyer to arrange the institution of divorce proceedings for a New York resident in a Mexican court, without allowing him to tell the client that the divorce might be invalid Querze v.

Nor are we in anywise persuaded by the argument in the brief of the Association of the Bar that there is any difference between the right of a Mexican lawyer to act and advise the public in divorce matters and the right 3 N.Y.2d 232 of foreign lawyers generally to act an advise with respect to foreign law.

The minority view, on the other hand, held that p blockquote id"blockquote36" In this century when the United States has become the creditor nation of the world and when the ramifications of our industrial, commercial, financial and recreational lives extend to every corner of the global, it is especially improbable that the Legislature intended to preclude the giving of legal advice in this State to our citizens concerning these farflung enterprises by trained lawyers from abroad who are equipped to give accurate information and opinions regarding them. The customary residential requirements for admission to the Bar would in themselves often preclude their becoming admitted to our Bar. The omission of the Legislature to enact statutes licensing or regulating the conduct of foreign lawyers in practicing purely foreign law in this State, does not indicate that such conduct is prohibited by sections 270 and 271 of the Penal Law, but merely that the Legislature has not seen fit to subject them to regulation. Whatever the merits of such span class"hiddentext" id"span46" 33span proposed legislation, it is not for us to enact it. blockquoteblockquote id"blockquote37" If foreign lawyers came under section 270 and 271 of the Penal Law, it would stifle their activities to the detriment of the large and increasing number of our nationals who engage in transactions in foreign countries, inasmuch as it would be impossible for most of them to be admitted to practice in this State. blockquotep datastructure"Precedent" id"p77"24. In Appell versus Reiner4, the Supreme Court of New Jersey dealt with a case of New York lawyer, who was not admitted to the New Jersey Bar, giving legal services to New Jersey residents in a matter involving the extension of credit and the compromise of claims held by New York and New Jersey creditors. The Chancery Division held that the New York lawyer could not advice in respect of New Jersey creditors. The Supreme Court of New Jersey held p blockquote id"blockquote38" The Chancery Division correctly delineated the generally controlling principle that legal services to be furnished to New Jersey residents relating to New Jersey matters may be furnished only by New Jersey counsel. We nevertheless recognize that there are unusual situations in which a strict adherence to such a thesis is not in the public interest. In this connection recognition must be given to the numerous multistate transactions arising in modern times. This is particularly true of our State, situated as it is in the midst of the financial and manufacturing center of the nation. An inflexible observance of the generally controlling doctrine may well occasion a result detrimental to the public interest, and it follows that there may be instances justifying such exceptional treatment warranting the ignoring of state lines. This is such a situation.

Again, there was a dissenting view as follows p blockquote id"blockquote39" Regulation of the interests of the public and the bar requires a rule of general application. In cases such as we have here, the only fair and workable rule is one which recognizes that the clients matter is primarily a New Jersey one and calls for the engagement of a member of our bar for the legal services to be rendered here. And, in that connection, in the interest of interstate amity, if an outof state attorney renders legal services in New Jersey which are a minor or incidental part of a total problem which has its principal and primary aspects in his state, he should be allowed to recover in our courts for the work done in this jurisdiction. blockquotep datastructure"Section" id"p80"26.

The authors comment is as follows blockquote span class"hiddentext" id"span51" 37span blockquote id"blockquote41" In an ICC arbitration, parties have the right to be represented by the persons of their choice. A distinction should however be made between authorized representatives and advisors. Usually, the parties have attorneys represent them in the arbitration. Thus, an attorney may have both capacities, but this may not always be the case. As an adviser, he or she would not need a power of attorney. On the other hand, as a representative of a party, he or she might need a power of attorney. In arbitration. The major centres of arbitration do not appear to have restrictions on the right of lawyers from other countries to argue cases in those countries, with the possible exception of California.

However, in a few recent cases that principle has been challenged9. III Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration In general, the parties may also be represented by engineers, or commercial men, for the purpose of putting forward the oral submissions, and even for the examination of witnesses. It is not uncommon, where a case involves technical issues, for an engineer or other professional man to be part of the team of advocates representing a party at a hearing, although it is more usual for such technical experts to be called as witnesses and the Tribunal. They are further authorized to retain, for the defense of their rights and interests before the Tribunal, counsel or advocates appointed by them for this purpose. span class"hiddentext" id"span54"6span Henry Bath amp Son Ltd. v.

However, in June 2004 Singapore finally amended its Legal Profession Act to eliminate this restriction on representation by foreign lawyers in arbitrations in Singapore. See also Birbrower, Montabano, Condon amp Frank v. Superior Court of Santa Clara County, 1998 Cal LEXIS 2, 1998 WL 1346 Cal 1598 where the court held that a New York lawyer representing a client in a Californian arbitration was not qualified to act for his client because he was not called to the Californian bar and therefore not entitled to recover his fees.

However, it may sometimes be convenient and save time if technical experts address the arbitral tribunal directly as party representatives10. p p datastructure"Precedent" id"p91" The Supreme Court of California held in 1998 that representing a party in an arbitration without its seat in California was engaging in the practice of law in that state. It followed that a New York lawyer, not a member of the Californian Bar, was not qualified to represent his client in a Californian arbitration and was thus unable to recover his fee when he sued for it 11. Fortunately the court stated that the rule did not apply in international arbitration. IN England there is not, and never has been, any danger of a similar situation arising12. A party to an arbitration may, in theory, be represented by his plumber, his dentist, or anyone else of his choosing, although the choice usually falls on a lawyer or specialist claims consultant in the relevant industry13.

In India, funding of litigation by advocates is not explicitly prohibited, but a conjoint reading of Rule 18 fomenting litigation, Rule 20 contingency fees, Rule 21 share or interest in an actionable claim and Rule 22 participating in bids in execution, etc. would strongly suggest that advocates in India cannot fund litigation on behalf of their clients.
