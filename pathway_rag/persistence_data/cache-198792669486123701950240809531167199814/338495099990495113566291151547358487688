Introduction
------------

The year 2023 marked a significant turning point for the Competition Commission of India (CCI), characterised by a blend of enforcement and merger control activities, and pivotal legislative amendments to the Competition Act 2002 (Competition Act). Throughout the year, the CCI (which witnessed a substantial institutional overhaul) navigated a landscape of evolving market dynamics and regulatory challenges while adapting to emerging trends and establishing regulatory expectations. This overview provides a comprehensive insight into the enforcement endeavours, merger control activities, and legislative transformations that occurred in 2023; and sheds light on the agency’s efforts to promote fair competition, boost contestability of markets and safeguard consumer interests in the Indian market.

Change of Guard at the CCI
--------------------------

Following Ashok Kumar Gupta’s retirement in October 2022, the CCI operated without a chairperson until 15 May 2023, when Ravneet Kaur assumed the role. Kaur officially began her tenure on 23 May 2023, becoming the first woman to hold this position full-time. Subsequently, other member positions in the CCI also became vacant, but were promptly filled, resulting in a fully staffed and diverse commission.

The Office of the Director General (DG Office) is also expected to experience a period of stability with the appointment of a new Director General (DG) who has prior experience at the CCI.

As is customary, the change in leadership at the CCI is anticipated to bring about shifts in regulatory priorities and approaches to market oversight. Early orders issued under the new commissioners already suggest this change in direction.

This transition coincides with a significant reforms to the Competition Act and the broader competition law framework in India. The newly appointed CCI members will be tasked with interpreting many of the novel changes to the competition law regime.

Enforcement activity
--------------------

The Competition Act along with its allied regulations and notifications, govern the Indian competition law landscape. Section 3 of the Competition Act prohibits horizontal and vertical anticompetitive agreements that cause or are likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC) in India.

Section 3(3) of the Competition Act prohibits horizontal agreements or cartels that engage in fixing prices, allocating areas of operation, customers or products, limiting production and supply, and technological innovation and bid rigging.

Section 3(4) of the Compatitoin Act prohibits all types of vertical agreements that cause AAEC in India. It specifically prohibits exclusivity arrangements, tie-in arrangements, refusal to deal and resale price maintenance if they cause AAEC in India.

Section 4 of the Competition Act forbids abuse of dominant position, including predatory pricing, denial of market access, imposing unfair or discriminatory conditions or prices and leveraging, among others.

Regulatory turf wars
--------------------

2023 was another year that saw significant action on the jurisdictional conflict between the CCI and other regulators. Pertinently, two important decisions were handed down by constitutional courts in this regard.

In June 2023, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (Supreme Court) held that Coal India Limited (CIL) was subject to the provisions of the Competition Act and ruled against the ouster of the CCI’s jurisdiction.[\[1](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-001) It rejected CIL’s argument that it was governed exclusively under the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act 1973 (Coal Act). CIL had argued that its operations were further to the greater ‘common good’ as envisaged under article 39(b) of the Constitution of India as well as the preamble to the Coal Act, and therefore, the applicability of the Competition Act would affect its ability to further the common good. The Hon’ble Supreme Court while noting that the Competition Act was a subsequent legislation and therefore, would prevail, it also observed that subjecting a monopoly enterprise such as CIL to the Competition Act was also in furtherance of the common good. The decision reinforces the principle of competitive neutrality, pursuant to which the Competition Act was held to be applicable equally to private and public sector enterprises.

On the other hand, the very next month, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court ruled that anticompetitive conduct arising out of licensing of patents would be examined under the Patents Act 1970 (Patents Act). The judgment noted that Patents Act being a special legislation and Chapter XVI of the Patents Act being a subsequent legislation vis-à-vis the Competition Act as well as a complete code, it would prevail over the Competition Act. While arriving at this conclusion, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court specifically considered that the subject-matter under focus in the dispute was not merely anticompetitive agreements and abuse of dominant position, but instead anticompetitive agreements and abuse of dominant position by a patentee in exercise of their rights under the Patents Act, which squarely falls within the domain of the Patents Act.[\[2](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-002)

Conflicts regarding regulatory turf have followed CCI for several years now, and 2024 may witness more instances of this turf war playing out.

### Higher courts have shown proclivity to not interfere in CCI investigations on grounds of constitutional violations

The CCI is seemingly well supported by the higher courts in its scrutiny of various sectors, particularly steel and cement sectors. Pursuant to an ongoing investigation of alleged cartel in the cement industry, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court had passed an order allowing the Builders Association of India (BAI) to submit an application to the CCI to seek a copy of the DG investigation report and provide its views and inputs. Subsequently, the CCI passed an order impleading the BAI as an interested party and accepted its request to access case records (Order).

Subsequently, UltraTech Cement (one of the investigated companies) filed a writ petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court challenging the Order. Through its judgment dated 18 December 2023, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court dismissed the writ petition since the Order took into consideration the twin tests that an applicant seeking access to records needs to meet: substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings, and public interest as per Regulation 25 of the CCI (General) Regulations 2009. While upholding the Order, it specifically noted that

> writ courts while exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India do not substitute the opinions arrived at by statutory bodies with their own, unless the decision arrived at by the statutory bodies are beyond their jurisdiction or there is a failure to exercise jurisdiction vested in them or the order passed is so perverse and illegal that it finds itself in contravention of Wednesbury principles.[\[3](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-003)

Dalmia Cement and India Cements (both under investigation) also filed writ petitions before the Hon’ble Madras High Court challenging the Order. A single judge bench of the Hon’ble Madras High Court dismissed the writ petitions for the lack of territorial jurisdiction since the Order arose based on an order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court. Further, the Hon’ble Madras High Court took note of the fact that the Order had already been challenged before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court and its decision was pending. Therefore, applying the principle of comity of courts, the Hon’ble Madras High Court dismissed the writ petitions. Both the cement manufacturers appealed before the division bench of the Hon’ble Madras High Court which were also dismissed. The Hon’ble Madras High Court noted that the CCI ought to have provided an opportunity of hearing to the appellants before passing the Order. However, by the time the appeals were filed, BAI had already conducted the inspection and had received the non-confidential version of the investigation report.[\[4](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-004)

Similarly, in an ongoing investigation by the CCI pertaining to allegations of cartelisation in the steel sector, Agni Steels and Shyam Steels filed writ petitions before the Hon’ble Madras High Court and the Hon’ble Calcutta High Court respectively. Interesting, the DG investigation was ordered without a prima facie order being passed by the CCI. The steel companies therefore, challenged the DG investigation for the lack of a statutorily mandated prima facie order which directs an investigation under Section 26(1) of the Competition Act. Through its order dated 18 May 2023, the Hon’ble Calcutta High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Shyam Steel denying it any interim relief on the ground that the investigation was already in an advanced stage, and allowed the DG investigation to proceed.[\[5](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-005) The Hon’ble Madras High Court, through its order dated 19 October 2023 dismissed the writ petition filed by Agni Steels while noting that whenever the CCI in its meetings deliberates and decides to register a case suo motu, a prima facie opinion is automatically arrived upon by the CCI and therefore greenlighted the DG’s investigation to move forward.[\[6](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-006)

In 2023, there was limited enforcement activity. However, a significant portion of the year has been dedicated to finalising specific sub-legislations aimed at effectively implementing the sweeping changes introduced by the amendment to the Competition Act. It is evident that the CCI’s focus throughout 2023 has been on laying the groundwork for a more active year for antitrust enforcement in 2024. With an updated legislative framework and accompanying regulations gradually being introduced, the CCI is well-prepared to adjudicate on several matters, including its ongoing investigations involving major players such as Apple, Amazon, Flipkart and Google.

Besides legislating attendant regulations to be read with amendments, the CCI focused on its advocacy initiatives by organising sensitisation workshops and seminars for creating awareness among various industry segments such as the pharmaceutical sector, telecom sector, e-commerce, startups, among others. The CCI has also consistently engaged in conducting extensive market studies for identifying concerns in complex markets along with potential measures for alleviating such identified concerns within those markets. The CCI recently published its market study titled ‘Dynamics of Competition in the Mining sector with a focus on iron ore’ where it carried out a detailed analysis of the mining sector, particularly the market for production and supply of iron ore. The CCI highlighted potential competition concerns along with certain suggestions for alleviating such concerns within the market for iron ore.[\[7](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-007) The CCI has also announced the initiative to conduct a market study within the artificial intelligence (AI) market considering how AI driven markets are susceptible to natural monopolies, owing to network effects and access to large amounts of data.

Merger control action
---------------------

Indian merger control regime is a mandatory and suspensory regime. Accordingly, transactions that breach any one of the eight thresholds provided under the Competition Act and cannot avail of any formal or informal exemptions require a mandatory approval from the CCI, and such transaction cannot be consummated in part or whole prior to the receipt of the CCI approval.

A typical transaction is ordinarily notified to the CCI in the Form I filing format, namely the short form. However, if the combined market share of the parties in any of the horizontally overlapping markets jointly exceed 15 per cent or if the market share of the parties in any of the vertically linked markets exceed 25 per cent, the parties are required to notify the transaction to the CCI in a Form II – a longer notification format. Transactions where the parties do not demonstrate any horizontal overlaps, vertical relationship or complementary linkages can secure an approval under the green channel route where approval is granted immediately upon filing of the merger notice (Green Channel Route).

Once a merger notice is filed, majority of transactions are approved in 30 working days. This is referred to a phase I clearance. During the phase I review, if the CCI is of the prima facie view that the transaction can cause an AAEC, it can initiate a detailed inquiry in terms of Section 29(2) (Phase II review). The CCI is empowered to receive voluntary remedies from parties, or it may order a conditional approval or block the transaction.[\[8](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-008) To date, the CCI has never blocked a transaction.

### Increased scrutiny of filings under the Green Channel Route

The Green Channel Route is a trust-based mechanism that was introduced by the CCI in August 2019. Such a filing is deemed to have been approved as soon as it is filed before the CCI. The Green Channel Route remained popular with 25 filings opting for the Green Channel Route in 2023 alone, accounting for a little under a third of all filings made to the CCI in 2023.

A filing under the Green Channel Route is premised on the parties’ ability to correctly undertake business activities’ overlaps assessment to conclude the lack of overlaps.

While until 2022, no filings under the Green Channel Route were subject to any penalties due to incorrect disclosures regarding the absence of overlaps, in 2023 CCI issued its first penalty for incorrect disclosure under the Green Channel Route. Funds belonging to TPG and ADIA were penalised for (1) consummating a transaction after incorrectly filing it under the Green Channel Route triggering a gun-jumping violation under Section 43A of the Competition Act; and (2) false disclosures regarding the absence of any overlaps between the parties, and thereby making a false statement which is actionable under Section 44 of the Competition Act.

For context, the case involved a joint acquisition of a 5 per cent stake by Platinum Trust (ADIA) and by the Upswing Trust (TPG) in UPL Sustainable Agri Solutions Limited (UPL SAS).[\[9](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-009) The transaction was notified to the CCI under the Green Channel Route and received a deemed approval. During routine post-filing scrutiny of the filing the CCI found that one of the acquirers held pre-existing shares in UPL Corporation (UPLC). Since UPLC was indirectly engaged in the same business as the UPL SAS, this negated the availability of the Green Channel Route. While issuing its order, the CCI held that the criteria for availing the Green Channel Route was objective and specific in nature and any overlap will take away the said benefit. The CCI also observed that, given the approval is ‘deemed’ in nature, parties availing of this benefit were expected to observe the utmost good faith in their assessment.

It is also understood that the CCI has initiated investigations against several other parties who are suspected to have incorrectly utilised the Green Channel Route. Therefore, in 2024, more orders from the CCI in relation to the outcome of such investigations can be expected.

### Activities’ overlap mapping is getting complex owing to low threshold of control

Under the CCI’s low threshold of material influence for determining control,[\[10](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-010) which has been codified under the Amendment Act (although yet to be in force), financial sponsors are being exposed to greater risks arising from sector consolidation.

The material influence standard requires financial sponsors are required to map overlaps not only with its own portfolio companies (where control exists as per the CCI) but also controlled entities of such portfolios (as per CCI’s low threshold of control).

The CCI tackled such a scenario in an order involving General Atlantic.[\[11](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-011) For background, General Atlantic Singapore ACK Pte. Ltd. (GAS) held 15.54 per cent shareholding in Acko Technology and Services Private Limited (Acko Tech) along with certain control rights and board seat. GAS proposed to additionally acquire 4.04 per cent shareholding in Acko Tech along with the right to appoint an additional director in Acko Tech, and the right to appoint an observer on the board of directors of Acko General Insurance Limited and Acko Life Insurance Limited. Interestingly, Acko Tech also held 2.95 per cent shareholding in Vivish Technologies Private Limited (Vivish) along with the right to appoint an observer.

The CCI noted that an existing portfolio of GAS, namely NoBroker Technologies Solutions Private Limited (NoBroker) and Vivish, operate gated community management software platforms each and are significant players in this market. The CCI concluded that GAS through its increase in control over Acko could effectively soften competition between NoBroker and Vivish. The CCI approved the transaction subject to GA either directly or indirectly:

*   not participating in, associating with or exerting influence on any matter or affair related to Vivish or investment of Acko Tech in Vivish;
*   not accessing, knowingly receive or becoming privy, to any non-public information relating to Vivish which is accessed or possessed by Acko Tech; and
*   not influencing or engaging with any person appointed by Acko Tech, as an observer on the board of Vivish or in any capacity.

The CCI’s order imposes a commitment on General Atlantic for perpetuity (ie, until it retains control over Acko). It also suggests that where private equity deals are notified to the CCI, it may require remedies to alleviate PE roll-up concerns even if such concerns do not relate to the direct notifying parties.

### Voluntary commitments on the rise

Under the Competition Act and the Combination Regulations, if the CCI forms a preliminary view that a transaction may result in an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India, it can initiate a detailed Phase 2 review, which is a time-consuming process.

However, the Combination Regulations permit notifying parties to propose voluntary modifications or commitments to assuage concerns of the CCI before a Phase 2 review is initiated.[\[12](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-012) In 2023, three transactions were approved subject to commitments, all of which were voluntarily offered by the parties to these transactions.

In the _Air India/Vistara_ merger (involving two large aviation companies), the CCI’s primary concern was that the combined entity pursuant to its high market shares would have the ability to reduce capacity on the overlapping routes, which would consequently lead to an increase in fares on such routes.[\[13](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-013) This concern was allayed by the parties by offering voluntary commitments to maintain capacity on the overlapping domestic (Bhubaneswar-Delhi, Bengaluru-Guwahati, Delhi-Cochin, Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram, Amritsar-Delhi, Bhubaneswar-Mumbai, and Bengaluru-Delhi) and international routes (Delhi-Paris, Delhi-Melbourne, Delhi-Frankfurt and Delhi-Sydney) for four years at levels dictated by International Air Transport Association regulations.

In _Ipca/Unichem_, while the target was not present in the Indian market, but to address concerns that could arise if the target were to enter the market in the future (i.e., a potential vertical overlap) on account of Target’s formulations business, the parties offered that the target will refrain from re-entering the Indian formulations market for at least 36 months following the closing of the transaction.[\[14](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-014)

The remedies offered by General Atlantic to secure the CCI’s approval for its investment in Acko have already been discussed in the previous section.

### Hostile takeovers on the forefront again

After Veolia Environment’s attempted hostile takeover of Suez SA where the CCI’s merger control regime was efficiently utilised as a stop-gap takeover defence, the CCI merger control regime has once again appears to have been an important dynamic in the hostile takeover attempt of Pricol Limited (Pricol) by Minda Corporation Limited (Minda).

The hostile acquisition began with Minda acquiring 15.7 per cent stake in Pricol through open market transactions, and subsequently seeking the CCI’s approval for increasing its stake in Pricol to 24.7 per cent. In response to this attempted hostile takeover, Pricol was able to obtain a ruling from the Hon’ble Madras High Court which restrained the CCI from reviewing the transaction. This stay was subsequently vacated and the CCI resumed its scrutiny of Minda’s notice.

During this process, Pricol made extensive submissions on the AAEC that would be caused to the market if the attempted hostile takeover was allowed by the CCI. Subsequently, as a result of the submissions, the CCI issued a show cause notice to formally initiate a Phase 2 investigation.

However, in early January 2024, Minda sold its existing shareholding in Pricol (ie, 15.7 per cent) to institutional investors, effectively withdrawing its hostile takeover. Pricol’s successful thwarting of Minda’s hostile takeover attempt by utilising the forum of the CCI once again showcases strategic utilisation of a competition regulator’s forum.

Round-up of the legislative developments
----------------------------------------

2023 has been an eventful year on the legislative front with the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022 (the Amendment Bill 2022) being further amended through the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2023 (the Amendment Bill 2023). On 11 April 2023, the Competition (Amendment) Act 2023 (the Amendment Act) received presidential assent, and on 18 May 2023, some of the provisions of the Amendment Act were notified.

Several provisions of the Amendment Act require further delegated legislations before they can be notified and fully implemented. Towards this requirement and in an effort to further streamline certain existing regulations, the CCI has published the draft CCI (Commitment) Regulations 2023 (the draft Commitment Regulation), the draft CCI (Settlement) Regulations 2023 (the draft Settlement Regulation), the draft CCI (Determination of Turnover or Income) Regulations (the draft Turnover Regulation), the draft CCI (Lesser Penalty) Regulations 2023 (the draft Leniency Regulation) and the draft CCI (Combinations) Regulation 2023 (the draft Combination Regulation), and the draft CCI (General) Regulation 2023 for public comments. The CCI also made certain amendments to the CCI (General) Regulations 2009 (the General Regulations).

The Competition (Amendment) Act 2023: Merger Control Highlights
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Casting a wider net with deal value threshold

In addition to the existing value of asset- and turnover-based thresholds prescribed under the Act, a new deal value threshold (DVT) has been introduced. Where a transaction will require a prior approval from the CCI if the value of any transaction exceeds 20 billion rupees and the target to the transaction has substantial business operations in India (SBOI). Pertinently, a transaction which breaches this threshold will not be able to avail of the Small Target Exemption.[\[15](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-015)

The introduction of deal value thresholds is expected to catch transactions (particularly in the digital sector) where target entities usually do not have a substantial asset base. However, this threshold is not proposed to be applicable solely to the digital sector.

On 5 September 2023, the CCI published the draft Combination Regulation proposing a framework for the implementation of the DVT, and specifically guidance on ascertaining ‘value of transaction’ and ‘SBOI’.

The draft Combination Regulations clarify that transaction value would include non-compete fees; consideration attributable to inter-connected transactions; consideration for transactional or incidental commercial arrangements entered within two years of the closing of the notifiable transaction; consideration for options and securities on an as converted basis; and consideration payable for contingencies.

Further, it also provides two essential clarifications regarding the ascertainment of transaction value – where the true and complete transaction value is not captured in transaction documents, the value considered by the board of directors (or a similar approving authority) should be considered; and where the precise transaction value cannot be established with reasonable certainty, the notifying party should presume that the DVT is met.

The draft Combination Regulation also noted that a target will be seen to have SBOI if:

*   10 per cent or more of its total global number of users, subscribers, customers, or visitors were in India, in the 12 months preceding the deal execution date, is;
*   10 per cent or more of its total global GMV was in India for the 12 months preceding the deal execution date, is; or 
*   the target’s turnover for the preceding financial year (FY) in India is 10 per cent or more of its total global turnover.

Given that the draft Combination Regulation is yet to be finalised, and these regulations are fundamental for the implementation of the DVT, the DVT has not been notified yet. However, it is likely that the draft Combination Regulation could be finalised in 2024 and DVT subsequently notified. It is possible that the final regulations may modify the ‘value of transaction’ or the ‘SBOI’ test.

### Old wine in new bottle – codification of control

The Amendment Act proposes to codify CCI’s longstanding interpretation of control to its lowest and most expansive threshold – the ability to exercise material influence. While the amendment essentially codifies CCI’s decisional practice of interpreting control as ‘material influence’, the amendment is yet to be notified by the government of India.

### Derogation of standstill obligations for open-market purchases

In alignment with global standards, the Amendment Act proposes to allow parties to close acquisitions through open offers and open market purchases, on a regulated stock exchange, pending the CCI’s approval. This will be subject to the acquirer not exercising any ownership or beneficial rights or interest in such shares, unless permitted by the relevant regulations.

The Draft Combination Regulations stipulate that for open market purchases, a notice must be filed within 30 days of the open market acquisition.

Prior to the receipt of the CCI’s approval, the acquirer is proposed to be allowed to:

*   avail economic benefits such as, receiving dividends, or participating in a rights issue, bonus issue, stock-splits or buy back;
*   dispose of shares or securities acquired;
*   exercise voting rights, but only in relation to matters relating to liquidation or insolvency proceedings.

However, the Draft Combination Regulations specifically prohibit the acquirer from directly or indirectly influencing the target’s activities in any manner.

This final position in this regard is expected to be crystalised once the Draft Combination Regulations are finalised and introduced.

### Enhanced penalties

Pursuant to the Amendment Act, the CCI may now penalise parties that fail to comply with its orders passed under sections 6, 43, 44 and 45 of the Competition Act, which deal with the power of the CCI to regulate combinations, and the power to impose penalties for failure to comply with the orders of the CCI or DG.

The Amendment Act has enhanced the penalties for furnishing false information or failing to furnish material information in merger control cases from 10 million rupees to 50 million rupees. Further, the scope of gun-jumping provisions has also been expanded to empower the CCI to penalise parties where they do not provide information requisitioned by the CCI to evaluate whether a non-notified transaction was actually reportable. The amendment has not been notified yet.

### Notifying transactions to the CCI to get dearer

The Draft Combination Regulations have proposed enhancing the filing fee for the short form (ie, Form I) from 2 million rupees to 3 million rupees, and the filing fee for the long form (ie, Form II) from 6.5 million rupees to9 million rupees. The amendment has not been notified yet.

The Competition (Amendment) Act 2023: Enforcement Highlights
------------------------------------------------------------

### Statutory recognition for hub and spoke cartels

The Amendment Act has expressly recognised hub-and-spoke cartels under section 3(3) of the Competition Act. Now, any party that participates or intends to participate in an anti-competitive horizontal agreement may be found liable under section 3(3) – irrespective of whether the party is competing with the cartel participants.

Non-rival firms who either ‘participated’ in a cartel or ‘intended to participate’ in a cartel can also be penalised for cartelisation under this amendment. Pursuant to this, common intermediaries will need to exercise caution in their dealings with rival firms.

It is pertinent to note that this amendment has been notified and therefore is in effect.

The draft Leniency Regulations also propose to allow intermediaries or facilitators of cartels to also file for leniency or leniency plus. The final Leniency Regulations are yet to be introduced.

### Introduction of the framework for settlements and commitments

The Amendment Act has introduced a framework for offering commitments and to enter settlements with the CCI, both of which are aimed at expeditiously redressal of anticompetitive market concerns.

The settlement mechanism will enable parties to apply for closure of proceedings after the DG submits the investigation report but before the CCI’s final order. Parties can apply for commitments after a DG investigation has begun but prior to the submission of the DG’s investigation report to the CCI. Pertinently, settlements and commitments will only be available to parties in investigations of vertical restraints and abuse of dominance and will not be available for investigations pertaining to horizontal coordination.

The draft Settlement Regulations have proposed a timeline of 45 days since the receipt of the DG’s investigation report for filing a settlement application. Similarly, the draft Commitment Regulations have proposed a timeline of 45 days since the receipt of CCI’s investigation order for filing a commitment application.

In addition to fact-based disclosures, such as, a full and true disclosure of material facts, past contraventions of the Act, and ongoing CCI proceedings, a settlement application and commitment application must include: the manner in which the proposal in the application will address the alleged contravention; competition concerns; and the manner of implementation and monitoring of the proposal in the application.

Pursuant to the receipt of a settlement or a commitment application, the CCI will form a prima facie opinion as to its satisfaction with the settlement or commitment application. If the CCI is not satisfied, the applicant, may submit a revised proposal within 15 days. Thereafter, the CCI shall invite third parties (including counter parties and the DG) to submit their opinion within 21 days. Further to the consideration of third-party opinions, the CCI may: agree to the proposal and close proceedings qua the applicant; reject the proposal; or seek a revised proposal. If the proposal is rejected, the CCI shall proceed with its inquiry under the Competition Act, after giving the settlement applicant or commitment applicant (as the case may be) an opportunity to be heard.

Importantly, the draft Settlement Regulations state that a settlement order shall not be construed as a finding of contravention. This means that in case of follow-on damages, applicants may face challenges in demonstrating loss in the capacity of a settlement applicant. As for commitments, since commitment orders shall be passed before the submission of the DG investigation report and there shall be no judicial determination of a violation, there arises no question of follow-on damages.

The provisions pertaining to settlement and commitment framework has not been notified, and is expected to be notified once the draft Settlement Regulations and the draft Commitment Regulations are finalised.

### Computation of penalty on global turnover

The Amendment Act defines turnover as ‘turnover derived from all the products and services by a person or an enterprise’. Therefore, while calculating penalties under the Amendment Act, the ‘global turnover’ generated from a multitude of products and services (irrespective of limited infringing products or services or location) will likely be considered by the CCI.

This amendment will likely be continued to be tempered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgment in Excel Crop Care v Competition Commission of India, where turnover was interpreted as turnover derived from the business in which the contravention has been found (ie, relevant turnover). The Hon’ble Supreme Court emphasized on the need to follow the doctrine of proportionality while imposing penalties, especially since the CCI’s powers to impose penalty under section 27 of the Competition Act is absolute, and therefore, must be exercised in a proportionate, reasonable and non-arbitrary manner.[\[16](https://globalcompetitionreview.com/review/the-asia-pacific-antitrust-review/2024/article/india-overhaul-of-regime-set-reshape-competition-landscape#footnote-016)

The amendment has not been notified yet.

### Mandatory pre-deposit for appeals

The right to appeal certain CCI orders before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal will be contingent on the payment of a mandatory deposit of 25 per cent of the penalty imposed by the CCI. This amendment is aimed at enhancing penalty recovery and preventing superficial appeals. This amendment has also been notified and is in effect.

### Leniency plus

The Amendment Act has introduced the leniency plus regime, which will allow the CCI to grant additional leniency to an existing leniency applicant in lieu of ‘true and vital’ disclosures vis-a-vis a separate undisclosed cartel. The objective is to encourage additional cartel disclosures by granting incentives to the disclosing party. This may result in disclosure of more cartels in related or different businesses in on-going cartel investigations.

According to the draft Leniency Regulation, an application can be made only prior to the receipt of a DG Report (by the CCI) in relation to the first cartel. The draft Leniency Regulation prescribes a format for making an application as a leniency plus applicant. Such an applicant is required to provide information pertaining to the first cartel and disclosures pertaining to the second cartel, including similarities in the products or services between the two cartels and an explanation as to how the two cartels are distinct. Once an application in this regard is received by the CCI, it would assess whether true and vital disclosures have been made in relation to the undisclosed cartel, and accordingly either accept or reject the application. Prior to rejecting the application, the CCI would give the applicant an opportunity of being heard.

The CCI shall have complete discretion in reducing the monetary penalty for the applicant. However, the CCI shall be guided by considerations such as the likelihood of the newly disclosed cartel being detected by the CCI or the DG without lesser penalty plus application; and (any other factor deemed relevant by the CCI. The provision pertaining to leniency plus has not been notified and is expected to be notified once the draft Leniency Regulation is finalised.

Towards a digital competition law
---------------------------------

On 22 December 2022, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance submitted its report titled ‘Anti-Competitive Practices by Big Tech Companies’ (the Report). The Report identified 10 different anti-competitive practices in digital markets (such as anti-steering, self-preferencing, bundling and tying, and unauthorised non-public data usage to one’s own advantage) and proposed a framework for addressing their adverse impact. Upon assessment of these practices and the developments in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Report recommended the formation of the Committee on Digital Competition Law (CDCL) to study the possibility of introducing a Digital Competition Act (DCA) for ex ante regulation of digital markets (ie, pre-determined rule-based enforcement). A nine-member CDCL was established on 6 February 2023 to study the facets of digital markets and draft the DCA.

The DCA will mark a fundamental shift in Indian antitrust regulation from the CCI’s ex post facto review of conduct to now an ex ante framework, in the digital markets. The DCA is expected to address the 10 different prevalent anticompetitive practices in digital markets as identified in the Report, and additional concerns that may be identified by the CDCL. Further, the DCA will lay down the process for identifying systematically important digital intermediaries (SIDIs) and lay down the new ex-ante regulatory framework that SIDIs will have to comply with under the DCA. This development comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the digital markets by the CCI, which has already imposed penalties on Google for abusing its dominant position in two different cases pertaining to the digital markets, and is currently investigating other digital market players such as Apple, Amazon, Flipkart, WhatsApp (Meta), etc.

Conclusion
----------

With over 10 years of regulatory experience and a significant body of jurisprudence developed within a relatively short span, the CCI continues to earn recognition, largely for the right reasons. The passing of the Amendment Act in 2023 and the ongoing efforts to introduce a range of regulations in 2024 indicate an imminent overhaul of India’s antitrust landscape. Some aspects of this change were already evident in 2023, with the CCI’s jurisprudence witnessing certain ‘first-time’ developments.

One area poised for significant attention in 2024 is the digital sector. The final phase of regulatory reform, expected to materialise in this sector, promises to introduce a digital competition legislation that will enhance the CCI’s regulatory capabilities. This comes at a crucial juncture, with the regulator already demonstrating a commitment to foster a competitive and contestable digital environment by investigating some of the largest players in the digital economy.

The focus in 2024 will also be on the new chairperson of the CCI, whose first year coincides with key legislative advancements in competition law in India. The new leadership of the CCI faces a unique challenge of putting into practice the legislative tools provided by the Amendment Act and other delegated regulations. Consequently, 2024 is expected to witness jurisprudential developments that have not been experienced before.

For enthusiasts of competition law, both within and outside India, 2024 promises to be an eventful year in the Indian antitrust journey.
