Jio and Airtel clash over DTH licence fee as regulatory review looms in India
=============================================================================

[telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com](https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/jio-airtel-at-loggerheads-again-over-licence-fee-for-dth-operators/115989420) â€” December 5, 2024, 04:01 AM UTC

Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are in conflict over the licence fee for direct-to-home (DTH) operators. Jio opposes waiving the fee, arguing that DTH services benefit from free spectrum, giving them an unfair advantage over other TV providers. Airtel advocates for eliminating the licence fee, claiming it creates inequality among TV distribution platforms. They suggest that broadcasters should bear the fee instead of DTH operators, and have called for a review of revenue definitions for DTH. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is consulting on these issues as part of a broader effort to update broadcasting regulations under the Telecommunications Act, 2023. The outcome could impact the financial obligations of DTH operators significantly.
