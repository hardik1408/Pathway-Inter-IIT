SEATTLE, Nov. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: Z and ZG), which is transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes, today announced its consolidated financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Complete financial results for the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024 can be found in our shareholder letter on the Investor Relations section of Zillow Group’s website at [https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx](https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx).

“Zillow had another strong quarter, with 17% total revenue growth year over year. I’m proud of how we are executing our strategy to serve renters, buyers, sellers, agents _and_ the broader residential real estate industry,” Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman said. “We continue to invest in tech solutions to build the integrated transaction experience consumers demand and deserve. These investments give Zillow an advantage as we connect high-intent movers with high-performing agents, driving adoption of our services and contributing to increased revenue.”

Recent highlights include:

*   Zillow Group’s third-quarter results exceeded the company’s outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.
    
*   Q3 total revenue was $581 million, up 17% year over year and above the midpoint of the company’s outlook range by $28 million. Q3 revenue outperformed the residential real estate industry total transaction value1 growth of 2%, as well as total industry purchase loan origination volume, which the company estimates declined in the low single digits in Q3.
    
    *   Residential revenue was up 12% year over year in Q3 to $405 million, benefiting from continued conversion improvements as more buyers and sellers transacted with Zillow agent partners.
        
    *   Rentals revenue increased 24% year over year to $123 million, primarily driven by multifamily revenue growing 38% year over year in Q3.
        
    *   Mortgages revenue increased 63% year over year to $39 million, primarily due to an 80% year-over-year increase in purchase loan origination volume to $812 million in Q3.
        
*   On a GAAP basis, net loss was $20 million, or 3% of total revenue, in Q3.
    
*   Q3 Adjusted EBITDA was $127 million, or 22% of total revenue, $24 million above the midpoint of the company’s outlook range, driven primarily by higher-than-expected Residential revenue.
    
*   Cash and investments at the end of Q3 were $2.2 billion, down from $2.6 billion at the end of Q2.
    
*   Traffic to Zillow Group’s mobile apps and sites in Q3 was 233 million average monthly unique users, up 1% year over year. Visits during Q3 were 2.4 billion, up 3% year over year.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of forecasted GAAP net income (loss) to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA within this press release because we are unable, without making unreasonable efforts, to calculate certain reconciling items with confidence. These items include but are not limited to: income taxes that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in the market price of the company’s capital stock; depreciation and amortization from new acquisitions; impairments of assets; gains or losses on extinguishment of debt; and acquisition-related costs. These items, which could materially affect the computation of forward-looking GAAP net income (loss), are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are outside of our control. We have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss) margin, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the same reasons.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
    
*   Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;
    
*   Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
    
*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment and restructuring costs;
    
*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs;
    
*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect loss on extinguishment of debt;
    
*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;
    
*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and
    
*   Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash-flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.
