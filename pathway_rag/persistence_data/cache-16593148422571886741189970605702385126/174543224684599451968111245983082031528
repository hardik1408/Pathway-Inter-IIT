SEATTLE, May 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: [Z](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zillow-group-reports-first-quarter-2024-financial-results-302133486.html#financial-modal) and ZG), which is transforming the way people buy, sell, rent and finance homes, today announced its consolidated financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Complete financial results for the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter of 2024 can be found in our shareholder letter on the Investor Relations section of Zillow Group's website at [https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4155058-1&h=3309253395&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.zillowgroup.com%2Finvestors%2Ffinancials%2Fquarterly-results%2Fdefault.aspx&a=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.zillowgroup.com%2Finvestors%2Ffinancials%2Fquarterly-results%2Fdefault.aspx).

"Zillow's strong revenue numbers across the business helped us once again meaningfully outperform the residential real estate industry as we continue to execute on our growth strategy and expand the breadth and depth of market coverage for the housing super app experience in 2024," said Zillow co-founder and CEO Rich Barton. "We've organically amassed and maintained a large, engaged audience and strong brand, and we've been investing heavily in software to digitize and integrate the end-to-end moving transaction for consumers, their agents, and their loan officers."

Recent highlights include:

*   Zillow Group's first-quarter results exceeded the company's outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

*   Q1 revenue was $529 million, up 13% year over year and above the midpoint of the company's outlook range by $26 million.  
      
    *   Residential revenue was up 9% year over year in Q1 to $393 million, outperforming both the residential real estate industry total transaction value1 growth of 4% and the company's outlook.  
          
        
    *   Rentals revenue of $97 million increased 31% year over year, primarily driven by multifamily revenue growing 46% year over year in Q1.  
          
        
    *   Mortgages revenue of $31 million increased 19% year over year, due primarily to a more than 130% year-over-year increase in purchase loan origination volume to $601 million in Q1. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in mortgage marketplace revenue.  
          
        
*   On a GAAP basis, net loss was $23 million, or 4% of total revenue, in Q1, compared with $22 million, or 5% of total revenue, in Q1 2023.

*   Q1 Adjusted EBITDA was $125 million, or 24% of total revenue, $25 million above the midpoint of the company's outlook range, driven primarily by higher-than-expected Residential revenue.

*   Cash and investments at the end of Q1 were $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion at the end of Q4 2023.

*   Traffic to Zillow Group's mobile apps and sites in Q1 was 217 million average monthly unique users, flat year over year. Visits during Q1 were 2.3 billion, up 3% year over year.

**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, this press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measure.

Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to measure operating performance and trends and to prepare and approve our annual budget. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.

Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

*   Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share-based compensation;

*   Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment costs;

*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or other income, net;

*   Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income taxes; and

*   Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently from the way we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash-flow metrics, net loss and our other GAAP results.

**Adjusted EBITDA**

The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss, for each of the periods presented (in millions, unaudited):
