"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   1   Foreword   The Austral ian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC’s) approach to merger  assessment has evolved significantly since the ACCC last published analytical guidelines in  the area of mergers in 1999. The changes in the ACCC’s approach have been developed in  line wi th international best practice, contemporary views on anti -trust analysis and the  ACCC’s experience since 1999. These revised guidelines have benefited  from valuable input  from the business and trade practices advisory community on an earlier draft, which was  released for consultation in February 2008.   These revised guidelines outline the general principles underpinning the ACCC’s merger   analysis under s. 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010  (the Act) , formerly the  Trade Practices Act 1974 . It is imp ortant to note that the approach taken in the revised  guidelines is not radically different from the approach contained in the 1999 guidelines  — the  competition test is the same and analysis of the market and merger factors remains a vital  element in merge r assessment.   However, the approach to merger assessment has been developed with an increased  emphasis on the competitive theories of harm and the effect of constraints, which facilitates  a more integrated analysis. The changes to the guidelines do not rep resent a new approach  by the ACCC but are rather a better reflection of the approach being undertaken by the  ACCC to merger reviews.   The ACCC will continue to assess each merger on its merits according to the specific nature  of the transaction, the industr y and the particular competitive impact likely to result in each  case. The general principles set out in these guidelines provide a framework within which  mergers will be reviewed. Importantly, the application of those principles to different facts  and sit uations may give rise to different results.   It is not possible for these guidelines to cover every issue or circumstance that may arise in  a merger review. In practice, individual mergers involve a great variety of facts and  situations, and the analysis of  particular issues may need to be tailored to the specific  circumstances of a merger or deal with competition issues not specifically considered in  these guidelines. Therefore the ACCC proposes to apply the revised guidelines flexibly.   The ACCC’s case -by-case approach to merger analysis is reflected in both the public  competition assessments issued for mergers considered to be of major public interest and in  the shorter summaries of reasons for merger decisions, which are available on the ACCC  website for a ll public merger reviews.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   2   1. Introduction   1.1. Mergers and acquisitions are important for the efficient functioning of the economy.  They allow firms to achieve efficiencies, such as economies of scale or scope, and  diversify risk across a range of activities. They also provide a mechanism to replace  the managers of underperforming firms.   1.2. In the vast majority of mergers, sufficient competitive tension remains after the  merger to ensure that consumers and suppliers are no worse off. Indeed, in many  cases consumers  or suppliers benefit from mergers. In some cases, however,  mergers have anti -competitive  effects. By altering the structure of markets and the  incentives for firms to behave in a competitive manner, some mergers can result in  significant consumer detriment.   Section 50 of the Act   1.3. Section 50 of the Act prohibits mergers that would have the effect, or be likely to have  the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market.   1.4. Section 50(3) requires the following non -exhaustive list of matters (or ‘merger  factors’) to be taken into account when assessing whether a merger would be likely to  substantially lessen competition:   (a) the actual and potential level of import competition in the market   (b) the height of barriers to entry to the market   (c) the level of concentratio n in the market   (d) the degree of countervailing power in the market   (e) the likelihood that the acquisition would result in the acquirer being able to  significantly and sustainably increase prices or profit margins   (f) the extent to which substitutes are available in  the market or are likely to be  available in the market   (g) the dynamic characteristics of the market, including growth, innovation and  product differentiation   (h) the likelihood that the acquisition would result in the removal from the market of a  vigorous and ef fective competitor   (i) the nature and extent of vertical integration in the market.   1.5. These matters or ‘merger factors’ illuminate the policy intent underlying s. 50.1 In  particular, they highlight key potential constraints on a merged firm (for example, new  entry and imports) and identify market characteristics that could potentially affect the  impact of a merger on competition (for example, growth in demand, innovation or the  level of vertical integration).

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   4   Types of mergers   1.12.  As outlined in appendix 2, s. 50 applies to a wide variety of mergers and acquisitions.  A ‘merge r’ involves the shareholders of two companies becoming the shareholders of  a new merged company. An ‘acquisition’ occurs when one company acquires a  shareholding in, or the assets of, another company. Generally, when assessing its  impact on competition, li ttle turns on whether a transaction is, strictly speaking, a  ‘merger’ or an ‘acquisition’. For convenience, these guidelines refer to ‘mergers’ and  ‘merger parties’.   1.13.  These guidelines  discuss three types of merger  — in each, the merger may involve  firms tha t are either actual or potential competitors:    horizontal  mergers  — involving actual or potential  suppliers of substitutable goods   or services    vertical mergers  — involving firms operating or potentially operating at different  functional levels of the same v ertical supply chain    conglomerate mergers  — involving firms that  interact or potentially interact across  several separate markets and supply goods or services that are in some way  related to each other, for example, products that are complementary in eithe r  demand or supply.   1.14.  Each type of merger has the potential to affect competition in a different way and will  therefore be analysed differently.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   4   Types of mergers   1.12.  As outlined in appendix 2, s. 50 applies to a wide variety of mergers and acquisitions.  A ‘merge r’ involves the shareholders of two companies becoming the shareholders of  a new merged company. An ‘acquisition’ occurs when one company acquires a  shareholding in, or the assets of, another company. Generally, when assessing its  impact on competition, li ttle turns on whether a transaction is, strictly speaking, a  ‘merger’ or an ‘acquisition’. For convenience, these guidelines refer to ‘mergers’ and  ‘merger parties’.   1.13.  These guidelines  discuss three types of merger  — in each, the merger may involve  firms tha t are either actual or potential competitors:    horizontal  mergers  — involving actual or potential  suppliers of substitutable goods   or services    vertical mergers  — involving firms operating or potentially operating at different  functional levels of the same v ertical supply chain    conglomerate mergers  — involving firms that  interact or potentially interact across  several separate markets and supply goods or services that are in some way  related to each other, for example, products that are complementary in eithe r  demand or supply.   1.14.  Each type of merger has the potential to affect competition in a different way and will  therefore be analysed differently. While some competition issues and theories of  competitive harm are presented separately in these guidelines, the ACCC will adopt  an approach tailored to the particular nature of the merger.   Acquisition markets   1.15.  These guidelines focus on potential competition concerns in supply markets into  which the merged firm supplies goods and services. However, there could also be   competition concerns in acquisition markets in which the merged firm acquires goods  and services. In particular, the merged firm may be able to depress the price paid for  the inputs below their competitive price by restricting its purchase of those inputs .

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   6   2. Notification threshold   2.1. While there is no compulsory pre -notification requirement for mergers in Australia, it  is recommended that certain mergers that may be subject to the Act (see a ppendix 2)  be voluntarily notified to the ACCC for review, well in advance of completion.   2.2. To assist merger parties and their advisers to determine whether they should notify  the ACCC, the ACCC has developed a notification threshold, outlined below. This  threshold has been established by the ACCC to filter and thereby limit the merger  reviews it conducts to those mergers which, in its view, may potentially raise  competition concerns. The notification threshold is set at a level that reflects the  ACCC’s exper ience in determining which mergers are more likely to raise competition  concerns and therefore require further investigation.5  2.3. If merger parties believe their merger proposal will meet the notification threshold,  they are encouraged to approach the ACCC on  a confidential and informal basis as  soon as there is a real likelihood that the merger may proceed to discuss possible  competition issues and options for having the matter considered.   2.4. Merger parties are also encouraged to approach the ACCC where the ACCC  has  indicated to a firm or industry that notification of mergers by that firm or in that  industry would be advisable.   2.5. Parties may choose to seek informal review or merger authorisation from the ACCC.  The informal review process provides flexibility in ter ms of timeframes, information  requirements and confidentiality, while the merger authorisation process has  mandated timeframes and transparency requirements.   2.6. If mergers that raise competition concerns are not notified to the ACCC in adequate  time for it to  conduct a review, the ACCC may seek to use its formal information - gathering powers and/or injunctive relief, to enable it to properly consider such  mergers to ensure no anti -competitive harm arises.   2.7. Mergers that fall outside the notification threshold wil l rarely require investigation by  the ACCC. However, the notification threshold is indicative only. It is intended to  provide a starting point for identifying those mergers that may raise competition  concerns and therefore require investigation in accordan ce with these guidelines.  Importantly, the notification threshold should not be confused with the concentration  threshold (set out in chapter 7) which the ACCC has regard to as part of an overall  assessment of whether a merger is likely to substantially le ssen competition under  s. 50.  2.8. As market shares are an imprecise indicator of likely competition effects, a merger  that does not meet the notification threshold may still raise competition concerns.  The  ACCC may therefore investigate such mergers, even if t hey have not been notified to  it.  2.9. For simplicity, the notification threshold is based on market shares. The calculation of  market shares depends critically on market definition. If there is uncertainty as to the  relevant market, it is preferable that marke t shares be calculated on the basis of the  market definition most likely to raise competition concerns. This will usually mean                                                   5 The ACCC determined the level of the notification threshold based on an analysis of all previous merger reviews where the  ACCC released a statement of issues. A statement of issues is released by the ACCC where, after an initial assessment, it  believes the merger requires further detailed assessment. The notification threshold is based on the market shares of the  merged firm in matters that proceeded to this stage ."," What is the purpose of the notification threshold established by the ACCC for mergers in Australia, and how does it relate to the ACCC's experience in reviewing mergers?"

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   8    3. The competition test   3.1. Competition is a state of ongoing rivalry between firms  — rivalry in terms of price,  service, technology and quality. Market participants are mutually constrained in their  pricing, output and related commercial decisions to some extent by the activity of  other market participants (or potential market participants). In other words, the greater  the degree of competition in a market, the less m arket power each market participant  will possess.   3.2. Mergers can alter the level of competition in a market. Some mergers enable the  merged firm to meet customer demand in a way that facilitates more intense  competition. Many mergers do not affect the level o f competition at all because there  are sufficient substitution possibilities to effectively constrain the merged firm.   3.3. Other mergers, however, lessen competition by reducing or weakening the  competitive constraints or reducing the incentives for competitiv e rivalry.6 Mergers  that increase the market power of one or more market participants may be  detrimental to consumers because they may lead to an increase in price, or  deterioration in some other aspect of the service offering (see the text box below)  —  the level of market power will be dependent on whether alternative actual or potential  supply options are available post -merger to effectively constrain the merged firm. If  market structure and circumstances mean that there is limited potential for alternati ve  supply options or substitution possibilities to constrain the merged firm, then it will be  profitable for the merged firm to raise prices despite the potential for lost sales to  alternative suppliers.   3.4. Further, mergers that increase market power may decr ease economic efficiency  (because transactions at the margin are deterred) thereby reducing gains from trade  and total welfare.   Market power and increases in price   The most obvious and direct manifestation of an increase in market power is the ability of  one or more firms to profitably raise prices post -merger for a sustained period. Market power  can, however, be exercised in other ways. For example, a firm with market power may:    lower the quality of its products without a compensating reduction in price    reduce the range or variety of its products    lower customer service standards, and/or    change any other parameter relevant to how it competes in the market.   While the exact nature of competitive detriment caused by a merged firm’s increased market  power will vary depending on the particular circumstances of the matter, the ACCC often  characterises an increase in market power as the ability to raise prices. References to  ‘raising prices’ in these guidelines should therefore be read as implicitly incorporating t he  exercise of market power in other non -price ways.                                                        6 For convenience the guidelines refer to any increase in market power as accruing to sellers in a relevant market.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   8    3. The competition test   3.1. Competition is a state of ongoing rivalry between firms  — rivalry in terms of price,  service, technology and quality. Market participants are mutually constrained in their  pricing, output and related commercial decisions to some extent by the activity of  other market participants (or potential market participants). In other words, the greater  the degree of competition in a market, the less m arket power each market participant  will possess.   3.2. Mergers can alter the level of competition in a market. Some mergers enable the  merged firm to meet customer demand in a way that facilitates more intense  competition. Many mergers do not affect the level o f competition at all because there  are sufficient substitution possibilities to effectively constrain the merged firm.   3.3. Other mergers, however, lessen competition by reducing or weakening the  competitive constraints or reducing the incentives for competitiv e rivalry.6 Mergers  that increase the market power of one or more market participants may be  detrimental to consumers because they may lead to an increase in price, or  deterioration in some other aspect of the service offering (see the text box below)  —  the level of market power will be dependent on whether alternative actual or potential  supply options are available post -merger to effectively constrain the merged firm. If  market structure and circumstances mean that there is limited potential for alternati ve  supply options or substitution possibilities to constrain the merged firm, then it will be  profitable for the merged firm to raise prices despite the potential for lost sales to  alternative suppliers.   3.4. Further, mergers that increase market power may decr ease economic efficiency  (because transactions at the margin are deterred) thereby reducing gains from trade  and total welfare.   Market power and increases in price   The most obvious and direct manifestation of an increase in market power is the ability of  one or more firms to profitably raise prices post -merger for a sustained period.

Not all mergers that lessen competition are prohibited by s. 50 of the Act; only those  that lessen competition substantially  are prohibited.7 The term ‘substantial’  has been  variously interpreted as meaning real or of substance ,8 not merely discernible but  material in a relative sense9 and meaningful.10 The precise threshold between a  lessening of competition and a substantial lessening of competition is a matter of  judgement and will always depend on the particular facts of the merger under  investigation. Generally, the ACCC takes the view that a lessening of competition is  substantial if it confers an increase in market power on the merged firm that is  significant an d sustainable. For example, a merger will substantially lessen  competition if it results in the merged firm being able to significantly and sustainably  increase prices.   3.6. The level at which an increase in market power is likely to become significant and  sustainable will vary from merger to merger. For example, an increase in price that is  very small in magnitude might also be significant. The ACCC considers  that firms  would generally be deterred from instituting a price increase, or only be able to  institute it for a transitory period, where effective competitive constraints exist or  where constraints are likely to become effective within a period of one to two years.   3.7. In some markets, particular characteristics, such as the prevalence of certain types of  long-term contracts between buyers and sellers, may prevent a merged firm from  exercising any market power it gains through the merger until some point in the future   — for example, at contract renewal. If the exercise of market power is likely to be  delayed in this way, the ACCC will focus on the period commencing at the point  where market power would be exercised (for example, at contract negotiations).   3.8. As outlined in chapter 4, a substantial lessening of competition must arise in a market  to contravene s. 50. However, this does not imply that a lessening of competition  must apply to the entire market or to all aspects of competition in the relevant  market.11  Competitive constraints  and the ‘merger factors’   3.9.

These  merger factors provide insight as to the likely competitive pressu re the merged firm  will face following the merger and the possible competitive effects of the merger. The  assessment of the competitive effects is based on the theories of competitive harm  —  namely, unilateral and coordinated effects.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   13   4. Market definition   4.1. Section 50 of the Act requires that a substantial lessening of competition occur in a  substantial market for goods and services in Austr alia, or a state, territory or region of  Australia.18 Accordingly, in assessing whether a merger substantially lessens  competition, the ACCC will examine the competitive impact of the transaction in the  context of the markets relevant to the merger.   4.2. Market definition establishes the relevant ‘field of inquiry’ for merger analysis,  identifying those sellers and buyers that may potentially constrain the commercial  decisions of the merger parties and the merged firm, and those participants,  particularly custome rs, that may be affected if the merger lessens competition.   4.3. While market definition is a useful tool for merger analysis, by itself it cannot  determine or establish a merger’s impact on competition. Accordingly, market  definition should not obscure factors  relevant to competition that fall outside the  relevant markets. Similarly, there is no presumption that other firms within a relevant  market necessarily provide an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm.  Other factors also relevant to merger analysis are outlined in chapters 5, 6 and 7.   4.4. It is rarely possible to draw a clear line around fields of rivalry. Indeed, it is often  possible to determine a merger’s likely impact on competition without precisely  defining the boundaries of the relevant m arket. For example, if the consolidation of  the merger parties’ activities is unlikely to substantially lessen competition in a narrow  product and geographic area, then it is also unlikely to do so in a more broadly  defined product and geographic area and,  therefore, a conclusive view on the  relevant market may not be necessary. Similarly, when a merger is likely to  substantially lessen competition in any number of potential markets, it may be  unnecessary to define the precise market boundaries.   4.5. This chapte r explains the concept of a market and the ACCC’s approach to  identifying and defining the scope of markets that are relevant to assessing a merger  under s. 50 of the Act.   The concept of a market   4.6. A market is the product and geographic space in which rivalr y and competition take  place.   4.7. Section 4E of the Act provides that a market includes goods or services that are  substitutable for, or otherwise competitive with, the goods or services under analysis.  Accordingly, substitution is key to market definition.   4.8. The ACCC focuses on two key dimensions of substitution in characterising markets:  the product dimension19 and the geographic dimension. In some cases, market  definition requires close attention to the functional levels of the supply chain that are  relevant to  a merger or the particular timeframe over which substitution possibilities  should be assessed. Generally, however, these functional and temporal  considerations form part of the product and geographic dimension analysis.  Consistent with the forward -looking  nature of merger analysis, the ACCC focuses on  the foreseeable future when considering the likely product and geographic  dimensions of a market.                                                    18 Section 50(6).   19 The term ‘product’ encompasses both goods and service for the purpose of discussion in these guidelines."," According to section 4.1, what specific legal requirement must be met for a merger to be considered a substantial lessening of competition in Australia, and what body is responsible for assessing this?"

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   14   4.9. Market definition is purposive, which means that the definition of a relevant market  cannot be separated from the particular merger under investigation. Market definition  always depends on the specific facts and circumstances of a merger, and current  evidence from market participants will often be critical. Decisions relating to market  definition in previous, albe it similar, merger inquiries will provide only limited  guidance.   The ACCC approach to defining a market   4.10.  The ACCC’s starting point for delineating relevant markets to assess a merger under  s. 50 of the Act is identifying the products and geographic regions actually or  potentially supplied by the merger parties.20 The ACCC then focuses on defining  markets in areas of activity where competitive harm could occur. This must be  assessed on a case -by-case basis. Generally, the ACCC focuses on overlaps  between the p roducts or geographic regions supplied by the merger parties, or some  other meaningful economic relationship  — such  as an actual or potential vertical  relationship or where the products supplied by the merger parties are complementary  in nature. It is not uncommon for more than one market to be identified in any  particular merger review.   4.11.  The ACCC then considers what other products and geographic regions, if any,  constitute relevant close substitutes in defining the market.21 Importantly, the ACCC  defines mar kets by reference to products and regions not by reference to the firms  actually supplying those products or regions at the time of the merger.   Substitution   4.12.  As outlined above, identifying relevant substitutes is key to defining a market.  Substitution invol ves switching from one product to another in response to a change  in the relative price, service or quality of two products (holding unchanged all other  relevant factors, such as income, advertising or prices of third products). Market  definition begins by  selecting a product supplied by one or both of the merger parties  in a particular geographic area and incrementally broadening the market to include  the next closest substitute until all close substitutes for the initial product are included.   4.13.  There are tw o types of substitution: demand -side substitution, which involves  customer -switching; and supply -side substitution, which involves supplier -switching.   Demand -side substitution   4.14.  Whether or not a product or region is a close substitute for a product supplied by one  or more of the merger parties, depends on likely switching behaviour in response to  an increase in the price, or decrease in the service or quality of that product. The  likelihood that a product (or group of products) will be a demand -side substitut e for a  product of one of the merger parties will be assessed according to:    the characteristics or functions  of the product  (the product  dimension of a  market). Comparable product characteristics and functionality will often be  indicative but are not suffi cient to determine whether products are demand -side  substitutes. Demand -side substitution depends on the willingness of customers to  switch from one product to another in response to a price increase                                                    20 There need not be t rade in a product for a separate market to exist — the potential for exchange can be sufficient.

It will often be possible on the demand -side, in some degree, to substitute a wide  variety of products in various geographic regions for the products of the merger  parties.

While the HMT is a useful tool for analysis, it is rarely strictly applied to factual  circumstances in a merger review because of its onerous data requirement.  Consequently, the ACCC will generally take a qualitative appr oach to market  definition, using the HMT as an ‘intellectual aid to focus the exercise’.23  Supply -side substitution   4.23.  In defining the product and geographic dimensions of the market the ACCC will also  consider supply -side substitutes. A product (or group of p roducts) may be a     supply -side substitute for a product of one of the merger parties if in response to an  increase in the price of the product:    the production facilities and marketing  efforts used for that  product  can be  switched quickly and without sign ificant investment to supply a demand -side  substitute for the product of the merger party (the product dimension of the  market)    the distribution  network used by the product  can be modified quickly and without   significant investment to supply the merger par ty’s customers at their present  location or within a distance they would likely travel (the geographic dimension of  a market)    it would be profitable for the current suppliers of the product  to make these  changes  — that is, the profits earned on the assets in their current use would be  less than if they were switched to supply a demand -side substitute for the product  of the merger party.   4.24.  The ACCC will treat one product as a supply -side substitute for another in cases  where all (or virtually all) of the capac ity for producing that product could profitably be  switched to supply an effective substitute to the other product quickly and without  significant investment in response to a price increase.   4.25.  For some products, only a proportion of total supply capacity cou ld feasibly be  switched quickly and at minimal cost (for example, because firms producing this  product use different technologies). In these cases, the capacity that could be  switched will be considered as potential new entry when conducting the competitio n  analysis rather than included in the market definition.   4.26.

Identifying geographic regions that may be close substitutes   The following are examples of the types of information the ACCC may require  to identify  close substitutes of the relevant  geographic region:    the portability of the relevant product  as determined by its perishability, weight,  etc.   transportation costs to move the relevant product  between regions (particularly the   transportation costs as a proportion of total value of the prod uct)   the costs to customers  of obtaining supply from alternative regions    any limitations on the ability of customers  to access alternative sources of supply in  alternative  regions    the costs of extending  or switching production and distribution  systems to s upply the  customers  in alternative regions    any regulatory or other practical constraints  on suppliers selling to alternative regions    records relating to trade flows and the actual movement  of customers  and/or  suppliers  between geographic regions, especiall y related to changes in relative prices across  regions in the recent past    views and business records of buyers and suppliers regarding  the likelihood of switching  between  geographic sources of supply    the relative price levels and price movements  of differe nt geographic sources of supply.

Section 50(6) of the Act states that ‘market’ means a substantial market in Australia,  or in a state, a territory or a region of Australia.   4.29.  The ACCC’s view is that the substantiality criteria could be satisfied in many ways  including by reference  to the size of the market in terms of number of customers, total  sales or geographic size. A market that is ‘small’ in some sense may still be  substantial.   4.30.  In particular, substantiality of a market is not necessarily related to geographic size. A  market m ay be small geographically (for example, a local market) but may also be  substantial within the region in which it is located. Alternatively, a market for the  supply of a product that is an essential but small ingredient in the production of one or  more ot her products sold in large markets may be considered substantial.   4.31.  Section 50(6) also states that ‘market’ means a market for goods or services in  Australia, or in a state, a territory or region of Australia. In addition, s. 4E specifies  that ‘market’ is a market in Australia.  The ACCC’s view is that this does not preclude  it from analysing a merger proposal in the context of a geographically broader market   — for example, a trans -Tasman market or even a global market  — provided that at  least some part of it is located in Australia.24 In most cases the ACCC will define the  relevant market to be Australia or a part of Australia, and take full account of any  competitive constraint provided by suppliers located outside Australia when  considering import competition  (as required by the merger factors  — see paragraphs  7.33 to 7.37).   Issues that may arise in market definition   Asymmetric substitution   4.32.  Substitution possibilities are not necessarily symmetric. Asymmetric demand -side  substitution occurs when substitution be tween two products only occurs in one  direction. For example, buyers of luxury cars may substitute to more ‘standard’ cars in  response to an increase in the price of luxury cars, but the opposite may not be the  case. Asymmetric supply -side substitution may  occur when one group of suppliers  has the same production facilities as another group of suppliers, but also has  additional facilities for supplying a slightly different good or service. For example,  suppliers of scheduled travel services might be able to  redeploy their facilities to  provide  charter travel services, but suppliers of charter travel services might face  significant investment or obstacles to supply scheduled travel services (such as  building terminal facilities).   Product differentiation   4.33.  Marke t definition establishes the boundaries for competitive  analysis but within those  boundaries the degree of substitution can vary. Indeed it is extremely rare for a  uniform level of substitution to exist across all products, services or regions within a  relevant market. For example, products that serve similar functions may be  differentiated rather than homogenous. Product differentiation often limits substitution  at the margins because certain customers do not view differentiated products as  comparable. For  example, brand loyalty may limit the extent of both demand - and                                                   24 See, for example, Riverstone Computer Services Pty Limited v IBM Global Financing Austr alia Limited  [2002] FCA 1608, at  [21]."," According to section 50(6) of the Act and the ACCC's interpretation, what are the various ways in which the ""substantiality"" of a market can be determined, and provide examples illustrating how a geographically small market can still be considered substantial?"

The extent to which product differentiation affects the constrain t provided by actual or  potential competitors in the market is taken into account when assessing the  competitive effects of a merger (often by reference to different ‘segments’ of the  market). While a substantial lessening of competition must arise in a ma rket to  contravene s. 50, this does not imply that the lessening of competition must apply to  the entire market or to all aspects of competition in the relevant market.25  Discrimination and captive customers   4.35.  In certain cases where substitution possibilities  are not uniform across consumer  groups, it may be appropriate to define separate markets for different consumer  groups. For example, some consumers may view two products to be highly  substitutable while other consumers may consider the products to be, at best, weak  substitutes. In such situations, the relative number and importance of each customer   class and the ability of suppliers (including the merger parties) to discriminate  between the customer  classes will be important when determining the appropriat e  product and/or geographic dimension of the market.   4.36.  The ability of suppliers to discriminate between customer classes will depend on their  ability to:    distinguish between those customers  that have the option  of substitution and  those who lack that option    prevent resale or arbitrage between the customer classes.   4.37.  If suppliers can discriminate, a customer that has limited substitution possibilities  receives different terms and conditions from suppliers to a customer that has strong  substitution possibilities.  In this situation it may be appropriate to consider two  separate markets for merger analysis. One market would include the relevant product  and the alternative product, and would focus on those consumers who have the  option of substitution. The second mar ket would not include the alternative product  and would focus on those consumers who are ‘captive’ or do not have the option of  substitution.   4.38.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   22   5. Unilateral effects   5.1. One of the main ways in which mergers can lessen competition is through unilateral  effects. Mergers have unilateral effects when they remove or weaken competitive  constraints in such a way that the merged firm’s unilateral market power is increased.  That is, as a result of the merger the merged firm finds it profitable to raise prices,  reduce output or otherwise exercise market power it has gained, and can do so, even  given the  expected response of other market participants to the resulting change in  market conditions.28  5.2. Where unilateral effects occur, other market participants’ responses may vary. In  some situations other market participants may respond in a pro -competitive way and  (at least partially) attempt to offset the merged firm’s behaviour. Alternatively, it may  be more profitable for other market participants to simply support the merged firm’s  conduct  — for example, if a merged firm exercises unilateral market power by raising  the price of its products, other firms supplying substitutes may respond by also raising  their prices, thereby exacerbating the competitive impact of the unilateral exercise of  market power. As this example illustrates, a unilateral exercise of mar ket power may  make it profitable for both the merged firm and its competitors to raise prices.   5.3. In determining whether unilateral effects arise and whether they are likely to result in  a substantial lessening of competition, the ACCC considers all of the me rger factors  contained in s. 50(3) of the Act and any other relevant factors. In particular, it  considers whether the broader actual and potential competitive  constraints  — such  as  new entrants, imports or countervailing power  — will limit any increase in the  unilateral market power of each remaining market participant. These factors are  discussed in more detail in chapter 7.   5.4. Although horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers can all potentially give rise to  unilateral effects, it is recognised that ver tical and conglomerate  mergers are  generally less likely than horizontal mergers to raise competition concerns. Since  much of the general guidance on horizontal mergers is also relevant to vertical and  conglomerate mergers, this section also identifies tho se competition issues that are  specific to non -horizontal mergers that the ACCC will take into account. Mergers that  involve both horizontal and non -horizontal effects will be assessed based on the  combined horizontal and non -horizontal impact on competiti on.  Horizontal mergers   5.5. Horizontal mergers involve firms that operate in the same relevant market or markets.  Horizontal mergers may give rise to unilateral effects by eliminating the actual or  potential competitive constraint that the merger parties exerte d on each other pre - merger. Two competing firms may constrain each other, including via the (actual or  potential) transfer of sales from one to the other as customers switch, or threaten to  switch, between them. If these two firms merge, the merger ‘intern alises’ any such  transfers within the merged firm, thereby removing this constraining effect. Where  there are limited effective constraints from other sources, this unilateral effect can  amount to a substantial lessening of competition.   5.6. Unilateral effects may arise in different ways depending on the characteristics of the  market  — some, but not all are outlined below. The most obvious way is when no                                                   28 This may be contrasted to coordinated effects arising from a merger where it may be profitable for the merged firm to raise  prices, reduce output or otherwise exercise market power because it considers t hat the responses of its rivals will be  directly influenced by its own actions. This may manifest as either tacit or explicit collusion (see chapter 6).","  According to section 5.1, how do mergers create unilateral effects, and what are the resulting consequences for the merged firm's market behavior?

In the absence of effective  competitive constraints fro m other sources, such as future entrants, imports or  countervailing power, a merger that leaves no rivals to the merged firm will likely  result in unilateral effects amounting to a substantial lessening of competition.   5.7. Unilateral effects may also arise whe re a merger results in markets characterised by  a single firm with market power and numerous other smaller competitors that can  supply only a small portion of the total market demand because of factors limiting  their ability to significantly expand output.  In these circumstances, consideration will  be given to whether the merged firm would have the ability and incentive to raise  prices for the segment of the market that the smaller competitors are unable to supply   — taking into account, amongst other factor s, the ability and incentives of these  smaller competitors to expand capacity.   5.8. In markets involving homogeneous products with no dominant firm, competition  analysis will focus on the strategic interaction between rivals competing on output or  capacity. Uni lateral effects may arise where the merged firm sets its post -merger  output level significantly below the level of output that would have prevailed absent  the merger and, despite the response of competitors, brings about a higher price than  would have prev ailed absent the merger.   5.9. In contrast, in markets where competition between firms selling differentiated  products is based on price, unilateral effects may arise where a merger between firms  previously supplying close substitutes is able to increase the pri ce of either or both of  the close substitutes.

Significance of the merger parties to the competitive process   5.11.  While some firms may be relatively small in terms of size and market share, they may  neverthe less have a significant influence on the competitiveness of the market.  Mergers involving such firms may result in unilateral effects by impeding or removing  significant aspects of competition, such as innovation or product development.   Closeness of merger  parties   5.12.  The ACCC will take into consideration the extent of competitive constraint that the  merger parties exert on each other pre -merger. Merger parties are more likely to be  close competitors  — and therefore provide each other with an effective constrai nt that  may be lost post -merger  — if they differ from rivals in respect of characteristics such  as:   product features and function    customer loyalty    production capacity    breadth of product  line and level of specialisation    distribution channel coverage    geograp hic presence                                                    29 In these guidelines, the term ‘rival’ includes both actual and potential rivals, unless the context o therwise specifies.","  According to section 5.7 of the 2017 Merger Guidelines, under what market conditions might a merger of a large firm with many smaller competitors lead to unilateral effects, and what factors would the ACCC consider in such a scenario?"

This may occur where rivals h ave  the ability and incentive to reposition or extend their product range relatively easily  and without significant cost in response to the merged firm increasing its prices. If the  competition lost through the merger would likely be replaced by other riva ls in the  market or new entrants within a one - to two -year period, a merger is less likely to  result in an increase in unilateral market power.   5.17.  In non -differentiated product markets, other factors that may influence the abilities  and incentives of rivals t o constrain the merged firm from unilaterally increasing  prices post -merger include whether:    rival firms have sufficient capacity or are able to profitably expand capacity    the merged firm is able to hinder entry or expansion by rivals through various  means  (for example, by controlling inputs, distribution channels and patents/other  IP and access to, or pricing of, different platforms)    the relevant products are sold under terms and conditions  likely to limit or curtail  the ability of rivals to compete effect ively for the customers of the merged firm  post-merger    customers are constrained in their ability to switch to rival suppliers of the merged  firm post -merger.","  Based on the entire document, what are the key differences in the analysis of unilateral effects in differentiated versus non-differentiated product markets?

However, in some cases conglomerate mergers can raise competition concerns  where they enable the merged fi rm to alter its operations or product offerings in a way  that forecloses the merged firm’s rivals and ultimately reduces the competitive  constraint they provide. For example, the merged firm’s rivals may be foreclosed if  the merged firm chooses to bundle o r tie complementary products, such that:    no product can be purchased or used separately    at least one product cannot be purchased or used separately, or    customers receive additional  benefits when they purchase or use the merged   firm’s products together (for  example, due to discounts, rebates or design  features).   5.27.

Provide examples of such information.
"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   28   Likely effect of foreclosure   5.38.  The ability and incentive of the merged firm to foreclose rivals may not of itself  increase the merged firm’s unilateral market power to the extent th at there is a  substantial lessening of competition. Consideration must also be given to the effect of  foreclosure on competition in the relevant market/s.   5.39.  Foreclosure need not result in rivals being forced to exit the market to have a  detrimental effect on  competition. Actual rivals may simply be forced to use more  expensive alternatives to those offered by the merged firm or may be discouraged  from expanding their operations. Potential rivals may be discouraged from entering  the market. Foreclosure lessens  competition when the merged firm  — and, in some  cases, certain of its rivals  — finds it profitable to increase the price charged to  intermediate and end consumers or decrease the price paid to upstream suppliers  below competitive levels.   5.40.  In determining wh ether a merger is likely to result in a substantial lessening of  competition, the ACCC considers all the merger factors contained in s. 50(3) of the  Act and other relevant factors. In particular, the following factors inform the ACCC’s  assessment as to whe ther the merged firm’s unilateral market power is likely to  increase to the extent that there is a substantial lessening of competition:    the proportion and significance of the firms that  are foreclosed as a result of the  merger    the proportion and significa nce of other firms still able to provide a constraint  over  the merged firm    the potential for the merger to raise barriers to entry by foreclosure or the threat  of  foreclosure to rivals in related markets.   5.41.  Two further factors that may be relevant in the con text of vertical mergers are:    the significance of the input to the production process of downstream rivals    the presence of countervailing power, particularly the ability of firms to integrate to  avoid foreclosure.   5.42.  An additional factor that may be relevant in the context of conglomerate mergers is  the proportion of customers likely to purchase the relevant products from the merged  firm. This must be sufficiently large to cause independent rivals to face a significant  decline in sales, resulting in increased costs. The level of competitive constraint  imposed by rivals may be detrimentally affected where economies of scale or network  effects34 are important features of the relevant markets, since foreclosure may  prevent the merged firm’s rivals from achieving mi nimum efficient scale.   5.43.  However, where a significant proportion of customers continue to purchase products  from independent rivals, a conglomerate firm is likely to continue to be constrained  post-merger. For example, where rivals are able to replicate the merged firm’s  offering through assembly of their own competing bundle, and therefore reap similar  cost savings and/or retain economies of scale or scope, they may be able to avoid or  minimise foreclosure and thereby continue to constrain the merged firm. T his may be  through organic growth, counter -merger or joint supply arrangements with suppliers  of the related product. Depending on the nature of the merged firm’s market power,  however, it may be difficult or impossible for rivals to replicate the merged f irm’s                                                   34 Network effects arise when a product becomes more valuable as the number of customers consumi ng it increases, thus  providing an advantage to firms that have an existing customer base over rivals and prospective entrants that do not.","  According to section 5.39 of the Merger Guidelines, how can foreclosure negatively impact competition even if rivals don't exit the market entirely?

An additional factor that may be relevant in the context of conglomerate mergers is  the proportion of customers likely to purchase the relevant products from the merged  firm. This must be sufficiently large to cause independent rivals to face a significant  decline in sales, resulting in increased costs.

However, where a significant proportion of customers continue to purchase products  from independent rivals, a conglomerate firm is likely to continue to be constrained  post-merger. For example, where rivals are able to replicate the merged firm’s  offering through assembly of their own competing bundle, and therefore reap similar  cost savings and/or retain economies of scale or scope, they may be able to avoid or  minimise foreclosure and thereby continue to constrain the merged firm.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   30   6. Coordinated effects   6.1. In add ition to unilateral effects, mergers can lessen competition through coordinated  effects. Mergers have coordinated effects when they assist firms in the market in  implicitly or explicitly coordinating their pricing, output or related commercial  decisions. A  merger may do so simply by reducing the number of firms among which  to coordinate, by removing or weakening competitive constraints or by altering certain  market conditions that make coordination more likely. Coordinated effects may occur  in addition to u nilateral effects so that the merged firm is able to achieve even higher  prices than it would on its own. In some cases, coordinated effects, either alone or in  conjunction with unilateral effects, may amount to a substantial lessening of  competition.   6.2. Horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers may give rise to coordinated effects in  a number of different ways. Some of these are discussed below, but coordinated  effects may also arise in ways that are not discussed here. Competitive constraints  and other f actors relevant to coordinated effects are discussed in chapter 7. Rather  than presenting horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers separately, this section  discusses the issues that the ACCC considers relevant across all three types of  merger.   Coordin ated conduct   6.3. Mergers have coordinated effects when they alter the nature of interdependence  between rivals such that coordinated conduct is more likely, more complete or more  sustainable. Interdependence arises when a market is characterised by a small  number of firms (an oligopoly or a duopoly), with each firm anticipating the response  of the other firms and devising their commercial strategies accordingly. If the  oligopolistic structure of a market persists over time  — for instance, because barriers  to en try and expansion shield incumbents from new competitors  — the repeated  nature of the competitive interaction can result in a range of coordinated conduct,  from muted competition through to tacit or explicit agreement between firms not to  compete. Although  firms may have the ability to engage in effective competition, they  may not have the incentive if they recognise that any short -term benefits from  competing will likely be eroded by lost sales once other firms respond. Coordinated  conduct can in some case s involve contravention of other provisions of the Act.   6.4. In some cases, a change in the nature of the interdependence among competitors  may lead to an implicit agreement among them to refrain from competing. This  behaviour is sometimes referred to as tacit collusion, since it involves active  coordination but no explicit agreement between firms. Firms may signal to each other  that they will not compete on price, output, customer allocation or indeed any other  parameter of competition. Where the products are r elatively homogenous,  coordinated terms are more likely to be based on price or output in markets, whereas  differentiated products may be more conducive to division of a market by customer  type or region. In certain circumstances, interdependence may resul t in explicit  collusion between firms, whereby firms explicitly agree to refrain from competing.   Conditions facilitating coordinated conduct   6.5. When assessing whether a merger is likely to give rise to coordinated effects, the  ACCC first assesses whether cond itions in the relevant market are likely to be  conducive to coordinated conduct. Generally, the potential for sustainable  coordination is greatest where:","  What are coordinated effects in the context of mergers, and how do they differ from unilateral effects, according to the 2017 update of the Merger Guidelines?

Mergers have coordinated effects when they assist firms in the market in  implicitly or explicitly coordinating their pricing, output or related commercial  decisions. A  merger may do so simply by reducing the number of firms among which  to coordinate, by removing or weakening competitive constraints or by altering certain  market conditions that make coordination more likely. Coordinated effects may occur  in addition to u nilateral effects so that the merged firm is able to achieve even higher  prices than it would on its own. In some cases, coordinated effects, either alone or in  conjunction with unilateral effects, may amount to a substantial lessening of  competition.   6.2. Horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers may give rise to coordinated effects in  a number of different ways. Some of these are discussed below, but coordinated  effects may also arise in ways that are not discussed here. Competitive constraints  and other f actors relevant to coordinated effects are discussed in chapter 7. Rather  than presenting horizontal, vertical and conglomerate mergers separately, this section  discusses the issues that the ACCC considers relevant across all three types of  merger.   Coordin ated conduct   6.3. Mergers have coordinated effects when they alter the nature of interdependence  between rivals such that coordinated conduct is more likely, more complete or more  sustainable. Interdependence arises when a market is characterised by a small  number of firms (an oligopoly or a duopoly), with each firm anticipating the response  of the other firms and devising their commercial strategies accordingly. If the  oligopolistic structure of a market persists over time  — for instance, because barriers  to en try and expansion shield incumbents from new competitors  — the repeated  nature of the competitive interaction can result in a range of coordinated conduct,  from muted competition through to tacit or explicit agreement between firms not to  compete. Although  firms may have the ability to engage in effective competition, they  may not have the incentive if they recognise that any short -term benefits from  competing will likely be eroded by lost sales once other firms respond. Coordinated  conduct can in some case s involve contravention of other provisions of the Act.   6.4. In some cases, a change in the nature of the interdependence among competitors  may lead to an implicit agreement among them to refrain from competing. This  behaviour is sometimes referred to as tacit collusion, since it involves active  coordination but no explicit agreement between firms. Firms may signal to each other  that they will not compete on price, output, customer allocation or indeed any other  parameter of competition. Where the products are r elatively homogenous,  coordinated terms are more likely to be based on price or output in markets, whereas  differentiated products may be more conducive to division of a market by customer  type or region.

The sustainability of coordination  rests upon repeated interaction, since  the prospect of future retaliation discourages  firms from pursuing more competitive strategies.   6.11.  Firms in a market will have an incentive to deviate from the consensus unless they  fear punishment that would outweigh the potential short -term gains from chea ting on  the terms of coordination. Punishment may simply involve a return to competitive  conditions or, for example, a ‘price war’. The incentive to cheat is increased if the  imposition of punishment is likely to be significantly delayed (for example, beca use                                                   35 In these guidelines, ‘settle on terms’ and ‘consensus’ do not necessarily involve communication or active coordina tion but are  intended to reflect muted competition, tacit collusion and explicit collusion.","  Section 6.11 discusses the incentive to deviate from a consensus. What factors increase this incentive, and what type of ""punishment"" might deter firms from deviating?"
"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   32   market transactions are infrequent). The credible threat of effective punishment alone  may be sufficient to deter cheating.   6.12.  The ability of coordinating firms to punish deviations is often increased where:    firms have similar cost structures  — low-cost f irms may not fear retaliation by  higher cost firms    firms compete against each other in more than  one market  — this provides  additional  markets in which to punish deviating firms    some firms have excess capacity, which enables them to increase output and  reduce prices in response to a deviation from the terms of coordination.   6.13.  Interdependence and coordination may therefore be facilitated by a merger that  creates firms with similar market shares, cost structures, production capacities and  levels of vertical int egration. Where there is firm asymmetry, smaller firms or firms  with lower cost structures may have more to gain from competing rather than  refraining from competition. In this regard, a vigorous and effective competitor may be  instrumental in disrupting i nterdependence and ensuring effective competition (see  paragraph 7.56).   Competitive constraints   6.14.  Coordination is unlikely to be sustained if it induces new entry or expansion by firms  in the relevant market that are not engaging in coordination.

Generally, assessing whether a merger is likely to give rise to coordinated effects  requires a close examination of the conditions prevailing in the relevant market and  the likely effect of the merger o n these conditions.

"Merger G uidelines 2008, updated 2017   33   7. Merger factors   7.1. Mergers result in unilateral and/or coordinated effects when they weaken or remove  the competit ive pressure on firms in a market. Where unilateral and/or coordinated  effects amount to a significant and sustainable increase in the market power of the  merged firm and/or other firms in a market, the merger is likely to substantially lessen  competition in contravention of the Act.   7.2. In assessing whether a merger is likely to result in a significant and sustainable  increase in market power, the ACCC must consider each of the merger factors set  out in s. 50(3) as well as any other relevant factors (see parag raph 1.4). These  merger factors provide insight about the likely competitive constraints that the merged  firm will face post -merger. The merger factors cover a broad range of possible  competitive constraints faced by the merged firm  — some assist in identi fying the  presence of direct constraints ,36 while others provide insight into less direct forms of  constraint relating to either the structure and characteristics of the market37 or the  behaviour of actual and potenti al participants in the market.38  7.3. The ACCC recognises that competitive constraints are not static and strategic  behaviour by market participants can affect competition. The significance of the  merger factors and the weight placed on them will depend on the actual matter under  investigation.   7.4. The lik ely presence of effective competitive constraints post -merger is a key indicator  that a merger is unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition. While all  the merger factors must be taken into consideration, it may not be necessary for all  factors to indicate that the merged firm would face effective competitive constraints.  In some cases a single constraint can be sufficient to prevent a significant and  sustainable increase in the market power of the merged firm while in other cases the  collective effect of several constraints may be required. Conversely, the absence of a  single particular constraint is unlikely to be indicative of an increase in market power  as a result of the merger.   7.5.

These  merger factors provide insight about the likely competitive constraints that the merged  firm will face post -merger. The merger factors cover a broad range of possible  competitive constraints faced by the merged firm  — some assist in identi fying the  presence of direct constraints ,36 while others provide insight into less direct forms of  constraint relating to either the structure and characteristics of the market37 or the  behaviour of actual and potenti al participants in the market.38  7.3. The ACCC recognises that competitive constraints are not static and strategic  behaviour by market participants can affect competition. The significance of the  merger factors and the weight placed on them will depend on the actual matter under  investigation.   7.4. The lik ely presence of effective competitive constraints post -merger is a key indicator  that a merger is unlikely to result in a substantial lessening of competition. While all  the merger factors must be taken into consideration, it may not be necessary for all  factors to indicate that the merged firm would face effective competitive constraints.  In some cases a single constraint can be sufficient to prevent a significant and  sustainable increase in the market power of the merged firm while in other cases the  collective effect of several constraints may be required. Conversely, the absence of a  single particular constraint is unlikely to be indicative of an increase in market power  as a result of the merger.   7.5. The order in which the merger factors and other sources o f constraint are considered  below reflects the order in which the ACCC generally undertakes its analysis and  does not reflect the priority or weight given to any particular factor. Indeed, many of  the factors are interrelated and the ACCC adopts an integra ted approach, taking into  account all potential competitive constraints.   Concentration and market shares39  7.6. Market concentration refers to the number and size of participants in the market. It  provides a snapshot of market structure as well as an approximati on of the size of the  merger parties, which can assist when considering the other merger factors. Changes  in market concentration over time can also reveal the frequency of new entry and  provide insight into the ability of new entrants and smaller competit ors to attract  custom and expand.                                                    36 For example, the level of actual and potential imports, height of barriers to entry, degree of countervailing power and the  availability of substitutes.   37 For exa mple, the dynamic characteristics of the market, level of concentration in the market and nature and extent of vertical  integration.   38 For example, the likelihood that the acquirer would be able to significantly and sustainably increase prices or profit ma rgins,  whether the acquisition will result in the removal of a vigorous and effective competitor and other relevant factors.   39 Refers to the merger factor contained in s. 50(3)(c).","What role do potential entrants and smaller competitors play in the ACCC's assessment of a merger's impact on competition, as described in section 7.6?"

The HHI threshold is not interchangeable with, or a substitute for, the notification  threshold (see chapter 2). Mergers that meet the notification threshold should be  notified to the ACCC regardless of the specific HHI and delta.",  The document mentions situations where a merger might raise competition concerns even if it falls below the HHI threshold.

The ACCC needs to be satisfied that actual or threatened entry post -merger is not  just possible but  likely in response to an attempted exercise of market power by the  merged firm. The likelihood of entry generally depends on the profitability of entering  the market. The ACCC will assess whether a new entrant could expect to make a  commercial return on i ts investment taking into account the price effects the  additional output may have on the market and the likely responses of the incumbent  firms and other costs/risks associated with entry.   7.25.  Factors likely to affect the profitability of entry include the ex amples of barriers  outlined in paragraphs 7.30 to 7.32. Evidence of the past success or failure of new  entrants in establishing themselves as effective competitors in the relevant market  may also provide insight into the profitability of entry into particu lar markets but will  not necessarily indicate ease of entry. To test the likelihood of entry where it is not  possible to identify potential new entrants, the ACCC requires identification of the  likely categories of entrants that could potentially enter.   Sufficiency of entry   7.26.  Entry must be of sufficient scale with a sufficient range of products to provide an  effective competitive constraint. In differentiated product markets, the sufficiency of  entry will critically depend on the ability and incentive43 of ent rants to supply a  sufficiently close substitute to that of the merged firm. Entry at the fringe of the market  is unlikely to constrain any attempted exercise of market power by incumbents if  incumbents are unlikely to lose significant sales to those fringe  entrants. Therefore  individual entry that is small -scale, localised or targeted at niche segments is unlikely  to be an effective constraint post -merger.   7.27.  Sufficiency does not require in all circumstances that one new entrant alone  duplicates the scale and all the relevant activities of the merged firm. Timely entry by  multiple firms may be sufficient if the combined effect of their entry would defeat or  deter the exercise of increased market power by the merged firm.   7.28.  The ACCC’s assessment of the timeliness,  likelihood and sufficiency of entry will  depend on the circumstances of each particular merger under consideration.  However, the underlying test is always whether the potential for entry provides an  effective competitive constraint that would prevent a si gnificant and sustainable  increase in the market power of market participants post -merger.

Entry at the fringe of the market  is unlikely to constrain any attempted exercise of market power by incumbents if  incumbents are unlikely to lose significant sales to those fringe  entrants.

Describe the circumstances under which a basic level of information might suffice versus when a wider range of information is needed in an informal merger review.

The ACCC  places greater weight on evidence that such strategies form part of the firm’s  business model. Also, if the relevant input does not account for a significant  proportion of the buyer’s total input costs, sponsored entry or backward  integration may be less likely.    The proportion of the  downstream market able to wield a credible threat  For  the countervailing power to offset or limit any market power arising from a merger,  it will usually not be sufficient if only one buyer or category of c ustomers is able to  bypass the merged firm post -merger. For example, the merged firm may be able  to increase prices charged to smaller buyers that ar e unable to bypass the  supplier while larger buyers with countervailing power are able to avoid the  increas e. A significant proportion of customers must be shielded from the effects  of market power if countervailing power is to prevent a substantial lessening of  competition in the relevant market/s.   Countervailing power   The following are examples of the types of information the ACCC may require to ascertain  the degree of countervailing power in the relevant market/s:    the relative strength of bargaining power possessed by customers of the products in the  relevant market/s    the extent  to which it is possible for c ustomers to bypass the merger parties by importing  or producing the product themselves, vertically integrating, or using an alternative  supplier.   In an informal merger review, providing a base level of information to the ACCC will, in non - controversial cas es, usually be sufficient to satisfy the ACCC of whether or not a substantial  lessening of competition is likely. Whether a wider range of information will be required by  the ACCC will be assessed on a case -by-case basis and will depend on the complexity o f  the matter and the potential competition concerns raised.   Dynamic characteristics of the market52  7.52.  The forward -looking nature of merger analysis means that the ACCC, when analysing  the competitive effect of a merger, must take into account the changing nat ure of the  market in the future. Dynamic changes may result from a range of factors including  market growth, innovation, product differentiation and technological changes. The  analysis of the effects of dynamic changes in the market is closely linked with  analysis of the other merger factors discussed in this chapter. The changes in the  market will be considered from two perspectives:    the extent to which the dynamic features of the market affect the likely competitive  impact of the merger    whether the merger  itself impacts on the dynamic features of the market.   7.53.
