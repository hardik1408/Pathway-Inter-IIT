Backup Withholding U.S. holders of Pioneer common stock generally will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) on any cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares of ExxonMobil common stock. A U.S. holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding, however, if the U.S. holder: • furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 or successor form (or appropriate substitute) included in the letter of transmittal sent to the U.S. holders after the closing of the Merger, and otherwise complies with all of the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; or • provides proof that the U.S. holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not an additional tax and generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S. holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS. This discussion of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is not tax advice. Holders of Pioneer common stock are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to their particular situations as well as any tax consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any U.S. state or local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty. 106']","The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger for U.S. holders of Pioneer common stock exchanging for ExxonMobil common stock include the recognition of gain or loss based on the fair market value of the ExxonMobil common stock received in the Merger and any cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares. The gain or loss will be calculated separately for each block of shares exchanged, with long-term capital gains generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. U.S. holders may also be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on cash proceeds from the sale of fractional shares, with backup withholding generally at a rate of 24% unless certain conditions are met.
